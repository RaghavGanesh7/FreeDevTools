It serves as a bridge between applications and the NBA's data services, offering both live game information and historical statistics.\n\n## Features\n\n- Live game data (scoreboard, box scores, play-by-play)\n- Player information and career statistics\n- Team game logs and statistics\n- League standings\n- Game results and schedules\n\n## Tools\n\n### Live Game Data\n\n- **nba_live_scoreboard**\n  - Fetch today's NBA scoreboard (live or latest)\n  - Returns game IDs, start times, scores, and broadcast details\n\n- **nba_live_boxscore**\n  - Fetch real-time box score for a given NBA game ID\n  - Provides detailed player and team statistics\n\n- **nba_live_play_by_play**\n  - Retrieve live play-by-play actions for a specific game\n  - Includes scoring plays, fouls, timeouts, and substitutions\n\n### Player Information\n\n- **nba_common_player_info**\n  - Retrieve basic information about a player\n  - Includes biographical data, height, weight, team, position\n\n- **nba_player_career_stats**\n  - Obtain a player's career statistics\n  - Available in different formats (per game, totals, per 36 minutes)\n\n- **nba_list_active_players**\n  - Return a list of all currently active NBA players\n\n- **nba_player_game_logs**\n  - Obtain a player's game statistics within a specified date range\n\n### Team Data\n\n- **nba_team_game_logs_by_name**\n  - Fetch a team's game logs using the team name\n  - Avoids needing to know the team's numeric ID\n\n- **nba_fetch_game_results**\n  - Fetch game results for a given team ID and date range\n\n- **nba_team_standings**\n  - Fetch NBA team standings for a given season and season type\n\n- **nba_team_stats_by_name**\n  - Fetch team statistics using the team name\n  - Supports different aggregation methods (totals, per game, etc.)\n\n- **nba_all_teams_stats**\n  - Fetch statistics for all NBA teams across multiple seasons\n\n### Schedule Information\n\n- **nba_list_todays_games**\n  - Returns scoreboard data for any specific date\n\n## Usage\n\nThe server is implemented using the MCP framework and can be run as a standalone service.\n\n```python\n# Start the server\npython nba_server.py\n# or\nmcp run nba_server.py\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- The server runs with a 30-second timeout for more reliable operation\n- Signal handlers are implemented for graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)\n\n### Usage with Claude Desktop\n\n#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)\n\n1. Clone this repository\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/obinopaul/nba-mcp-server.git\ncd nba-mcp-server\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. Build the Docker image\n```\ndocker build -t nba_mcp_server .\n```\n\n4. Run the Docker container\n```\ndocker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name nba_mcp_server nba_mcp_server\n```\n\n5. Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"nba_mcp_server\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"exec\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"nba_mcp_server\",\n        \"python\",\n        \"nba_server.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Direct Python Execution\n\n1. Clone this repository\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/obinopaul/nba-mcp-server.git\ncd nba-mcp-server\n```\n\n2. Create a new environment\n```\nconda create --name your_env_name python=3.13\nconda activate your_env_name\n```\n\n3. Install dependencies\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n4. Run NBA mcp server on the terminal\n```\nmcp run nba_server.py\n```\n\n5. Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`, adjusting the Python path as needed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"nba_mcp_server\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/your/python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/nba_server.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter adding your chosen configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the NBA server. You'll then be able to use all the NBA data tools in your conversations with Claude.\n\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe server is built on:\n- NBA API (nba_api) Python package\n- MCP for API interface\n- Pydantic for input validation\n- Pandas for data manipulation\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is available under the MIT License.",
