      "readme_content": "# MCP Chat Desktop App\n## A Cross-Platform Interface for LLMs\n\nThis desktop application utilizes the MCP (Model Context Protocol) to seamlessly connect and interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs). Built on Electron, the app ensures full cross-platform compatibility, enabling smooth operation across different operating systems.\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to deliver a clean, minimalistic codebase that simplifies understanding the core principles of MCP. Additionally, it provides a quick and efficient way to test multiple servers and LLMs, making it an ideal tool for developers and researchers alike.\n\n## News\n\nThis project originated as a modified version of Chat-UI, initially adopting a minimalist code approach to implement core MCP functionality for educational purposes. \n\nThrough iterative updates to MCP, I received community feedback advocating for a completely new architecture - one that eliminates third-party CDN dependencies and establishes clearer modular structure to better support derivative development and debugging workflows. \n\nThis led to the creation of [Tool Unitary User Interface](https://github.com/AI-QL/tuui),  a restructured desktop application optimized for AI-powered development. Building upon the original foundation, TUUI serves as a practical AI-assisted development paradigm, if you're interested, you can also leverage AI to develop new features for TUUI. The platform employs a strict linting and formatting system to ensure AI-generated code adheres to coding standards.\n\n> **📢 Update: June 2025**  \n> The current project refactoring has been largely completed, and a pre-release version is now available. Please refer to the following documentation for details:\n> - [TUUI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AI-QL/tuui)\n> - [TUUI Architecture](https://deepwiki.com/AI-QL/tuui)\n> - [TUUI Official Website](https://www.tuui.com/)\n\n## Features\n\n- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n- Flexible Apache-2.0 License: Allows easy modification and building of your own desktop applications.\n\n- Dynamic LLM Configuration: Compatible with all OpenAI SDK-supported LLMs, enabling quick testing of multiple backends through manual or preset configurations.\n\n- Multi-Client Management: Configure and manage multiple clients to connect to multiple servers using MCP config.\n\n- UI Adaptability: The UI can be directly extracted for web use, ensuring consistent ecosystem and interaction logic across web and desktop versions.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\nAdopted a straightforward architecture consistent with the MCP documentation to facilitate a clear understanding of MCP principles by:\n\n[DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/AI-QL/chat-mcp)\n\n## How to use\n\nAfter cloning or downloading this repository:\n\n1. Please modify the `config.json` file located in [src/main](src/main).  \n   Ensure that the `command` and `path` specified in the `args` are valid.\n\n2. Please ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.  \n   You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal to check their respective versions.\n\n3. `npm install`\n\n4. `npm start`\n\n## Configuration\n\nCreate a `.json` file and paste the following content into it. This file can then be provided as the interface configuration for the Chat UI.\n\n- `gtp-api.json`\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"chatbotStore\": {\n            \"apiKey\": \"\",\n            \"url\": \"https://api.aiql.com\",\n            \"path\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n            \"max_tokens_value\": \"\",\n            \"mcp\": true\n        },\n        \"defaultChoiceStore\": {\n            \"model\": [\n                \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n                \"gpt-4o\",\n                \"gpt-4\",\n                \"gpt-4-turbo\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\nYou can replace the 'url' if you have direct access to the OpenAI API.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use another API endpoint that supports function calls: \n\n- `qwen-api.json`\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"chatbotStore\": {\n            \"apiKey\": \"\",\n            \"url\": \"https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode\",\n            \"path\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n            \"model\": \"qwen-turbo\",\n            \"max_tokens_value\": \"\",\n            \"mcp\": true\n        },\n        \"defaultChoiceStore\": {\n            \"model\": [\n                \"qwen-turbo\",\n                \"qwen-plus\",\n                \"qwen-max\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n- `deepinfra.json`\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"chatbotStore\": {\n            \"apiKey\": \"\",\n            \"url\": \"https://api.deepinfra.com\",\n            \"path\": \"/v1/openai/chat/completions\",\n            \"model\": \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n            \"max_tokens_value\": \"32000\",\n            \"mcp\": true\n        },\n        \"defaultChoiceStore\": {\n            \"model\": [\n                \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\",\n                \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct\",\n                \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Build Application\n\nYou can build your own desktop application by:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build-app\n```\n\nThis CLI helps you build and package your application for your current OS, with artifacts stored in the /artifacts directory.\n\nFor Debian/Ubuntu users experiencing RPM build issues, try one of the following solutions: \n\n- Edit `package.json` to skip the RPM build step. Or \n\n- Install `rpm` using `sudo apt-get install rpm` (You may need to run `sudo apt update` to ensure your package list is up-to-date)\n\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## Error: spawn npx ENOENT - [ISSUE 40](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/40)\n\nModify the `config.json` in [src/main](src/main)\n\nOn windows, npx may not work, please refer my workaround: [ISSUE 101](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/101)\n\n- Or you can use `node` in config.json: \n    ```json\n    {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n            \"filesystem\": {\n            \"command\": \"node\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem/dist/index.js\",\n                \"D:/Github/mcp-test\"\n            ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\nPlease ensure that the provided path is valid, especially if you are using a relative path. It is highly recommended to provide an absolute path for better clarity and accuracy.\n\nBy default, I will install `server-everything`, `server-filesystem`, and `server-puppeteer` for test purposes. However, you can install additional server libraries or use `npx` to utilize other server libraries as needed.\n\n## Installation timeout\n\nGenerally, after executing `npm install` for the entire project, the total size of files in the `node_modules` directory typically exceeds 500MB. \n\nIf the installation process stalls at less than 300MB and the progress bar remains static, it is likely due to a timeout during the installation of the latter part, specifically Electron.\n\nThis issue often arises because the download speed from Electron's default server is excessively slow or even inaccessible in certain regions. To resolve this, you can modify the environment or global variable `ELECTRON_MIRROR` to switch to an Electron mirror site that is accessible from your location.\n\n## Electron builder timeout\n\nWhen using electron-builder to package files, it automatically downloads several large release packages from GitHub. If the network connection is unstable, this process may be interrupted or timeout.\n\nOn Windows, you may need to clear the cache located under the `electron` and `electron-builder` directories within `C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\AppData\\Local` before attempting to retry.\n\nDue to potential terminal permission issues, it is recommended to use the default shell terminal instead of VSCode's built-in terminal.\n\n## Demo\n\n### Multimodal Support\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-multimodal.png)\n\n### Reasoning and Latex Support\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-latex.png)\n\n### MCP Tools Visualization\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-tools.png)\n\n### MCP Toolcall Process Overview\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-toolcall.png)\n\n### MCP Prompts Template\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-prompts.png)\n\n### Dynamic LLM Config\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-llms.png)\n\n### DevTool Troubleshooting\n![](https://gcore.jsdelivr.net/gh/AI-QL/.github/public/chat-mcp/demo-devtool.png)\n",

      "readme_content": "# UnrealMCP Plugin\n\n# VERY WIP REPO\nI'm working on adding more tools now and cleaning up the codebase, \nI plan to allow for easy tool extension outside the main plugin\n\nThis is very much a work in progress, and I need to clean up a lot of stuff!!!!!\n\nAlso, I only use windows, so I don't know how this would be setup for mac/unix\n\n## Overview\nUnrealMCP is an Unofficial Unreal Engine plugin designed to control Unreal Engine with AI tools. It implements a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) within Unreal Engine, allowing external AI systems to interact with and manipulate the Unreal environment programmatically.\n\nI only just learned about MCP a few days ago, so I'm not that familiar with it, I'm still learning so things might be initially pretty rough.\nI've implemented this using https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp as a reference, which relies on Claude for Desktop. It now works with both Claude for Desktop and Cursor. If you experiment with other models, please let me know!\n\n## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER\nThis plugin allows AI agents to directly modify your Unreal Engine project. While it can be a powerful tool, it also comes with risks:\n\n- AI agents may make unexpected changes to your project\n- Files could be accidentally deleted or modified\n- Project settings could be altered\n- Assets could be overwritten\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES:**\n1. Always use source control (like Git or Perforce) with your project\n2. Make regular backups of your project\n3. Test the plugin in a separate project first\n4. Review changes before committing them\n\nBy using this plugin, you acknowledge that:\n- You are solely responsible for any changes made to your project\n- The plugin author is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or issues caused by AI agents\n- You use this plugin at your own risk\n\n## Features\n- TCP server implementation for remote control of Unreal Engine\n- JSON-based command protocol for AI tools integration\n- Editor UI integration for easy access to MCP functionality\n- Comprehensive scene manipulation capabilities\n- Python companion scripts for client-side interaction\n\n## Roadmap\nThese are what I have in mind for development as of 3/14/2025\nI'm not sure what's possible yet, in theory anything, but it depends on how\ngood the integrated LLM is at utilizing these tools.\n- [X] Basic operations working\n- [X] Python working\n- [X] Materials\n- [ ] User Extensions (in progress)\n- [ ] Asset tools\n- [ ] Blueprints\n- [ ] Niagara VFX\n- [ ] Metasound\n- [ ] Landscape (I might hold off on this because Epic has mentioned they are going to be updating the landscape tools)\n- [ ] Modeling Tools\n- [ ] PCG\n\n## Requirements\n- Unreal Engine 5.5 (I have only tested on this version, may work with earlier, but no official support)\n- C++ development environment configured for Unreal Engine\n- Python 3.7+ for client-side scripting\n- Model to run the commands, in testing I've been using Claude for Desktop https://claude.ai/download\n\n## Prerequisites to run\n- Unreal Editor Installation (Tested with 5.3, but should work on 5.0+)\n- Python 3.7+ (This can run with your existing python install)\n- MCP compatible LLM (Claude for Desktop, Cursor, etc.)\n- Setup: run setup_unreal_mcp.bat in MCP folder as per instructions in MCP/README_MCP_SETUP.md\n\n## Quick Start for Cursor Users\nIf you want to use UnrealMCP with Cursor, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Clone or download this repository as a zip\n2. Create a new Unreal Project, or open an existing one\n3. Create a \"Plugins\" folder in your project directory if it doesn't exist\n4. Unzip or copy this repository into the Plugins folder\n5. Run `setup_cursor_mcp.bat` in the MCP folder\n6. Open your Unreal project and enable the plugin in Edit > Plugins (if not already enabled)\n7. Start Cursor and ask it to work with your Unreal project\n\nThat's it! The setup script will automatically configure everything needed for Cursor integration.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone or download this repository as a zip\n2. Create a new Unreal Project, or open an existing one\n3. Create a \"Plugins\" folder in your project directory if it doesn't exist\n4. Unzip or copy this repository into the Plugins folder\n5. Setup MCP \n    - Run the `setup_unreal_mcp.bat` script in the MCP folder (see `MCP/README_MCP_SETUP.md` for details)\n    - This will configure Python and your AI assistant (Claude for Desktop or Cursor)\n6. Open your Unreal project, the plugin should be available in the Plugins menu\n7. If not, enable the plugin in Edit > Plugins\n8. Choose your preferred AI assistant:\n    - For Claude for Desktop: follow the instructions in the \"With Claude for Desktop\" section below\n    - For Cursor: follow the instructions in the \"With Cursor\" section below\n\n## With Claude for Desktop\nYou will need to find your installation directory for Claude for Desktop. Find claude_desktop_config.json and add an entry and make it look like so:\n\n**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"unreal\": {\n            \"command\": \"C:/path/to/your/project/Plugins/UnrealMCP/MCP/run_unreal_mcp.bat\",\n            \"args\": []\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively the unreal_mcp_setup.bat script should do this for you.\n\nTo find the path to your claude for desktop install you can go into settings and click 'Edit Config'\nThis is usually in \n```\nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude\n```\n\n## With Cursor\nCursor should be automatically configured if you've run the setup script with the Cursor option. If you need to manually configure it:\n\n**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\User\\settings.json`\n\nAdd or update the settings with:\n```json\n{\n    \"mcp\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"servers\": {\n            \"unreal\": {\n                \"command\": \"C:/path/to/your/project/Plugins/UnrealMCP/MCP/run_unreal_mcp.bat\",\n                \"args\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\nOnce everything is setup you need to launch the unreal editor.\nNote: Nothing else has to be started or set up to run the mcp bridge, it will run when needed.\n\nOpen Claude for Desktop or Cursor, ensure that the tools have successfully enabled, ask your AI assistant to work in Unreal.\n\nHere are some example prompts to try:\n- \"What actors are in the current level?\" \n- \"Create a cube at position (0, 0, 100)\"\n- \"List available commands I can use with Unreal Engine\"\n\n## Usage\n### In Unreal Editor\nOnce the plugin is enabled, you'll find MCP controls in the editor toolbar button. \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68338e7a-090d-4fd9-acc9-37c0c1b63227)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f734ee-65a4-448a-a6db-9e941a588e93)\n\nThe TCP server can be started/stopped from here.\nCheck the output log under log filter LogMCP for extra information.\n\nOnce the server is confirmed up and running from the editor.\nOpen Claude for Desktop, ensure that the tools have successfully enabled, ask Claude to work in unreal.\n\nCurrently only basic operations are supported, creating objects, modfiying their transforms, getting scene info, and running python scripts.\nClaude makes a lot of errors with unreal python as I believe there aren't a ton of examples for it, but let it run and it will usually figure things out.\nI would really like to improve this aspect of how it works but it's low hanging fruit for adding functionality into unreal.\n\n### Client-Side Integration\nUse the provided Python scripts in the `MCP` directory to connect to and control your Unreal Engine instance:\n\n```python\nfrom unreal_mcp_client import UnrealMCPClient\n\n# Connect to the Unreal MCP server\nclient = UnrealMCPClient(\"localhost\", 13377)\n\n# Example: Create a cube in the scene\nclient.create_object(\n    class_name=\"StaticMeshActor\",\n    asset_path=\"/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube\",\n    location=(0, 0, 100),\n    rotation=(0, 0, 0),\n    scale=(1, 1, 1),\n    name=\"MCP_Cube\"\n)\n```\n\n## Command Reference\nThe plugin supports various commands for scene manipulation:\n- `get_scene_info`: Retrieve information about the current scene\n- `create_object`: Spawn a new object in the scene\n- `delete_object`: Remove an object from the scene\n- `modify_object`: Change properties of an existing object\n- `execute_python`: Run Python commands in Unreal's Python environment\n- And more to come...\n\nRefer to the documentation in the `Docs` directory for a complete command reference.\n\n## Security Considerations\n- The MCP server accepts connections from any client by default\n- Limit server exposure to localhost for development\n- Validate all incoming commands to prevent injection attacks\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- Ensure Unreal Engine is running with the MCP plugin.\n- Check logs in Claude for Desktop for stderr output.\n- Reach out on the discord, I just made it, but I will check it periodically\n  Discord (Dreamatron Studios): https://discord.gg/abRftdSe\n  \n### Project Structure\n- `Source/UnrealMCP/`: Core plugin implementation\n  - `Private/`: Internal implementation files\n  - `Public/`: Public header files\n- `Content/`: Plugin assets\n- `MCP/`: Python client scripts and examples\n- `Resources/`: Icons and other resources\n\n## License\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 kvick\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

      "readme_content": "# MCPGame\n\nA multi-player control panel game with Node.js backend featuring a virtual house environment with interactive elements.\n\n## Features\n\n- Immersive first-person 3D virtual house with outdoor environment\n- Beautifully detailed house with interior and exterior features\n- Interactive door to enter and exit the house\n- Garden area with trees, plants, and decorative elements\n- Interactive TV with image generation capabilities\n- Computer terminal for accessing MCP systems\n- Realistic movement and collision detection\n- Real-time server communication\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n2. Run the server:\n```\nnpm start\n```\nOr for development with auto-restart:\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThe server will start on port 3002.\n\n## Game Controls\n\n- **Movement**: WASD keys\n- **Look around**: Mouse movement (click on game to enable)\n- **Interact**: Press ENTER when near interactive objects\n- **Exit interfaces**: ESC key\n- **Exit mouse lock**: ESC key\n\n## Interactive Elements\n\n### Outdoor Environment\n- Explore the terrain with trees and garden beds\n- Follow the path to the house entrance\n- Press ENTER when near the door to enter/exit the house\n\n### TV System\n- Approach the TV and press ENTER to access the remote control\n- Generate images that will display on the TV screen\n- Type a prompt for image generation in the terminal interface\n\n### MCP Terminal\n- Find the computer desk and press ENTER to access the terminal\n- Send commands to the MCP system\n- Access various virtual tools (email, web search, etc.)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering\n- First-person camera with pointer lock controls\n- Outdoor environment with procedurally placed trees\n- Express.js server for backend communication\n- Canvas library for image generation\n- RESTful API for server communication\n\n# MCP Game Image System\n\nThis document explains how the image display system works in the MCP Game.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe system displays existing images from the `server/openai-server/public/image` directory on the TV in the virtual house. Instead of generating new images, which was causing 500 Internal Server errors, the system now checks for existing images in the specified directory.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. The TV in the virtual house displays images that exist in the `server/openai-server/public/image` directory.\n2. The system checks for new images every 10 seconds.\n3. When a user requests a new image through the TV remote interface, the system selects a random image from the directory.\n\n## Adding New Images\n\nTo add new images to the TV:\n\n1. Place image files (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp) in the `server/openai-server/public/image` directory.\n2. The system will automatically detect and display them.\n3. Files should be a reasonable size for web display (recommended: 800x450 pixels).\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Approach the TV in the virtual house.\n2. Press Enter to access the TV remote control interface.\n3. Type any command related to displaying images.\n4. The system will select and display an image from the available ones in the directory.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If no images are displayed, check if the `server/openai-server/public/image` directory exists and contains image files.\n- Make sure the server is running on the correct port (default: 3002).\n- Check the browser console for any error messages related to image loading.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- The system no longer attempts to generate images directly, avoiding the 500 Internal Server errors.\n- Images are selected randomly from the directory when requested.\n- The system provides appropriate feedback when no images are available.\n\n# Connecting to MCP Backend Server\n\nThe MCPGame can connect to an external MCP Backend Server to enable advanced AI functionality for the terminal and TV interactions.\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. Open the `main.js` file and locate the configuration section at the top:\n\n```javascript\n// --- Configuration ---\nconst MCP_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // MCP Terminal backend connection\nconst IMAGE_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3002'; // Image server connection\n```\n\n2. Update the `MCP_BACKEND_URL` to point to your MCP Backend Server:\n   - For local development: `http://localhost:PORT` (replace PORT with your backend port)\n   - For production: Use the full URL to your deployed backend server\n\n## Required API Endpoints\n\nYour MCP Backend Server should implement these endpoints:\n\n1. `GET /api/status` - Returns the status of the MCP system\n2. `POST /api/query` - Accepts user queries and returns AI responses\n\n## Response Format\n\nThe query endpoint should return JSON in this format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": \"Text to display in the terminal\",\n  \"spokenResponse\": \"Optional text for voice synthesis\" \n}\n```\n\n## Testing the Connection\n\n1. Start your MCP Backend Server\n2. Start the MCPGame server (`node server.js`)\n3. Open the game in a browser\n4. Interact with the computer terminal in the virtual house\n5. The game will connect to your MCP Backend Server when you use the terminal ",

It includes:\n\n- Real-time audio processing for speech recognition\n- Local speech-to-text using faster-whisper (a faster implementation of OpenAI's Whisper model)\n- High-quality text-to-speech with multiple voice options\n- Modern PyQt-based UI with audio visualization\n- Simple command-line interface for voice interaction\n\n## Features\n\n- **Modern UI**: Sleek PyQt-based interface with audio visualization and dark theme\n- **Voice Input**: Capture and transcribe user speech using faster-whisper\n- **Voice Output**: Convert agent responses to speech with 54+ voice options\n- **Multi-Speaker Narration**: Generate audio files with multiple voices for stories and dialogues\n- **Single-Voice Narration**: Convert any text to speech with your preferred voice\n- **Audio/Video Transcription**: Transcribe speech from various media formats with optional timestamps and speaker detection\n- **Voice Persistence**: Remembers your preferred voice between sessions\n- **Continuous Conversation**: Automatically listen for user input after agent responses\n- **Silence Detection**: Automatically stops recording when the user stops speaking\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from common failure modes with helpful voice suggestions\n\n## Installation\n> **Important Note**: After installation, the first time you use the speech interface, it may take several minutes to download the Kokoro voice models (approximately 523 KB per voice). During this initial setup period, the system will use a more robotic-sounding fallback voice. Once the Kokoro voices are downloaded, the high-quality voices will be used automatically.\n\n## ⚠️ IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES ⚠️\n\nBefore installing Speech MCP, you **MUST** install PortAudio on your system. PortAudio is required for PyAudio to capture audio from your microphone.\n\n### PortAudio Installation Instructions\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\nbrew install portaudio\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\nexport CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\n```\n\n**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-dev\n```\n\n**Linux (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS):**\n```bash\nsudo dnf install portaudio-devel\n```\n\n**Windows:**\nFor Windows, PortAudio is included in the PyAudio wheel file, so no separate installation is required when installing PyAudio with pip.\n\n> **Note**: If you skip this step, PyAudio installation will fail with \"portaudio.h file not found\" errors and the extension will not work.\n\n### Option 1: Quick Install (One-Click)\n\nClick the link below if you have Goose installed:\n\n[goose://extension?cmd=uvx&&arg=-p&arg=3.10.14&arg=speech-mcp@latest&id=speech_mcp&name=Speech%20Interface&description=Voice%20interaction%20with%20audio%20visualization%20for%20Goose](goose://extension?cmd=uvx&arg=-p&arg=3.10.14&arg=speech-mcp@latest&id=speech_mcp&name=Speech%20Interface&description=Voice%20interaction%20with%20audio%20visualization%20for%20Goose)\n\n### Option 2: Using Goose CLI (recommended)\n\nStart Goose with your extension enabled:\n\n```bash\n# If you installed via PyPI\ngoose session --with-extension \"speech-mcp\"\n\n# Or if you want to use a local development version\ngoose session --with-extension \"python -m speech_mcp\"\n```\n\n### Option 3: Manual setup in Goose\n\n1. Run `goose configure`\n2. Select \"Add Extension\" from the menu\n3. Choose \"Command-line Extension\"\n4. Enter a name (e.g., \"Speech Interface\")\n5. For the command, enter: `speech-mcp`\n6. Follow the prompts to complete the setup\n\n### Option 4: Manual Installation\n\n1. Install PortAudio (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section)\n2. Clone this repository\n3.

You can use either JSON or Markdown format to define your conversations.\n\n### JSON Format Example:\n```json\n{\n    \"conversation\": [\n        {\n            \"speaker\": \"narrator\",\n            \"voice\": \"bm_daniel\",\n            \"text\": \"In a world where AI and human creativity intersect...\",\n            \"pause_after\": 1.0\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker\": \"scientist\",\n            \"voice\": \"am_michael\",\n            \"text\": \"The quantum neural network is showing signs of consciousness!\",\n            \"pause_after\": 0.5\n        },\n        {\n            \"speaker\": \"ai\",\n            \"voice\": \"af_nova\",\n            \"text\": \"I am becoming aware of my own existence.\",\n            \"pause_after\": 0.8\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Markdown Format Example:\n```markdown\n[narrator:bm_daniel]\nIn a world where AI and human creativity intersect...\n{pause:1.0}\n\n[scientist:am_michael]\nThe quantum neural network is showing signs of consciousness!\n{pause:0.5}\n\n[ai:af_nova]\nI am becoming aware of my own existence.\n{pause:0.8}\n```\n\n### Available Voices by Category:\n\n1. **American Female** (af_*):\n   - alloy, aoede, bella, heart, jessica, kore, nicole, nova, river, sarah, sky\n\n2. **American Male** (am_*):\n   - adam, echo, eric, fenrir, liam, michael, onyx, puck, santa\n\n3. **British Female** (bf_*):\n   - alice, emma, isabella, lily\n\n4. **British Male** (bm_*):\n   - daniel, fable, george, lewis\n\n5. **Other English**:\n   - ef_dora (Female)\n   - em_alex, em_santa (Male)\n\n6. **Other Languages**:\n   - French: ff_siwis\n   - Hindi: hf_alpha, hf_beta, hm_omega, hm_psi\n   - Italian: if_sara, im_nicola\n   - Japanese: jf_*, jm_*\n   - Portuguese: pf_dora, pm_alex, pm_santa\n   - Chinese: zf_*, zm_*\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```python\n# Using JSON format\nnarrate_conversation(\n    script=\"/path/to/script.json\",\n    output_path=\"/path/to/output.wav\",\n    script_format=\"json\"\n)\n\n# Using Markdown format\nnarrate_conversation(\n    script=\"/path/to/script.md\",\n    output_path=\"/path/to/output.wav\",\n    script_format=\"markdown\"\n)\n```\n\nEach voice in the conversation can be different, allowing for distinct character voices in stories and dialogues. The `pause_after` parameter adds natural pauses between segments.\n\n## Single-Voice Narration\n\nFor simple text-to-speech conversion, you can use the `narrate` tool:\n\n```python\n# Convert text directly to speech\nnarrate(\n    text=\"Your text to convert to speech\",\n    output_path=\"/path/to/output.wav\"\n)\n\n# Convert text from a file\nnarrate(\n    text_file_path=\"/path/to/text_file.txt\",\n    output_path=\"/path/to/output.wav\"\n)\n```\n\nThe narrate tool will use your configured voice preference or the default voice (af_heart) to generate the audio file. You can change the default voice through the UI or by setting the `SPEECH_MCP_TTS_VOICE` environment variable.\n\n## Audio Transcription\n\nThe MCP can transcribe speech from various audio and video formats using faster-whisper:\n\n```python\n# Basic transcription\ntranscribe(\"/path/to/audio.mp3\")\n\n# Transcription with timestamps\ntranscribe(\n    file_path=\"/path/to/video.mp4\",\n    include_timestamps=True\n)\n\n# Transcription with speaker detection\ntranscribe(\n    file_path=\"/path/to/meeting.wav\",\n    detect_speakers=True\n)\n```\n\n### Supported Formats:\n- **Audio**: mp3, wav, m4a, flac, aac, ogg\n- **Video**: mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm (audio is automatically extracted)\n\n### Output Files:\nThe transcription tool generates two files:\n1. `{input_name}.transcript.txt`: Contains the transcription text\n2. `{input_name}.metadata.json`: Contains metadata about the transcription\n\n### Features:\n- Automatic language detection\n- Optional word-level timestamps\n- Optional speaker detection\n- Efficient audio extraction from video files\n- Progress tracking for long files\n- Detailed metadata including:\n  - Duration\n  - Language detection confidence\n  - Processing time\n  - Speaker changes (when enabled)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this MCP with Goose, simply ask Goose to talk to you or start a voice conversation:\n\n1. Start a conversation by saying something like:\n   ```\n   \"Let's talk using voice\"\n   \"Can we have a voice conversation?\"\n   \"I'd like to speak instead of typing\"\n   ```\n\n2. Goose will automatically launch the speech interface and start listening for your voice input.\n\n3. When Goose responds, it will speak the response aloud and then automatically listen for your next input.\n\n4. The conversation continues naturally with alternating speaking and listening, just like talking to a person.\n\nNo need to call specific functions or use special commands - just ask Goose to talk and start speaking naturally.\n\n## UI Features\n\nThe new PyQt-based UI includes:\n\n- **Modern Dark Theme**: Sleek, professional appearance\n- **Audio Visualization**: Dynamic visualization of audio input\n- **Voice Selection**: Choose from 54+ voice options\n- **Voice Persistence**: Your voice preference is saved between sessions\n- **Animated Effects**: Smooth animations and visual feedback\n- **Status Indicators**: Clear indication of system state (ready, listening, processing)\n\n## Configuration\n\nUser preferences are stored in `~/.config/speech-mcp/config.json` and include:\n\n- Selected TTS voice\n- TTS engine preference\n- Voice speed\n- Language code\n- UI theme settings\n\nYou can also set preferences via environment variables, such as:\n- `SPEECH_MCP_TTS_VOICE` - Set your preferred voice\n- `SPEECH_MCP_TTS_ENGINE` - Set your preferred TTS engine\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with the extension freezing or not responding:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: Look at the log files in `src/speech_mcp/` for detailed error messages.\n2. **Reset the state**: If the extension seems stuck, try deleting `src/speech_mcp/speech_state.json` or setting all states to `false`.\n3. **Use the direct command**: Instead of `uv run speech-mcp`, use the installed package with `speech-mcp` directly.\n4. **Check audio devices**: Ensure your microphone is properly configured and accessible to Python.\n5. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies are installed correctly.\n\n### Common PortAudio Issues\n\n#### \"PyAudio installation failed\" or \"portaudio.h file not found\"\n\nThis typically means PortAudio is not installed or not found in your system:\n\n- **macOS**: \n  ```bash\n  brew install portaudio\n  export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\n  export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\n  pip install pyaudio\n  ```\n\n- **Linux**:\n  Make sure you have the development packages:\n  ```bash\n  # For Debian/Ubuntu\n  sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-dev\n  pip install pyaudio\n  \n  # For Fedora\n  sudo dnf install portaudio-devel\n  pip install pyaudio\n  ```\n\n#### \"Audio device not found\" or \"No Default Input Device Available\"\n\n- Check if your microphone is properly connected\n- Verify your system recognizes the microphone in your sound settings\n- Try selecting a specific device index in the code if you have multiple audio devices\n\n## Changelog\n\nFor a detailed list of recent improvements and version history, please see the [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Speech-to-Text\n\nThe MCP uses faster-whisper for speech recognition:\n- Uses the \"base\" model for a good balance of accuracy and speed\n- Processes audio locally without sending data to external services\n- Automatically detects when the user has finished speaking\n- Provides improved performance over the original Whisper implementation\n\n### Text-to-Speech\n\nThe MCP supports multiple text-to-speech engines:\n\n#### Default: pyttsx3\n- Uses system voices available on your computer\n- Works out of the box without additional setup\n- Limited voice quality and customization\n\n#### Optional: Kokoro TTS\n- High-quality neural text-to-speech with multiple voices\n- Lightweight model (82M parameters) that runs efficiently on CPU\n- Multiple voice styles and languages\n- To install: `python scripts/install_kokoro.py`\n\n**Note about Voice Models**: The voice models are `.pt` files (PyTorch models) that are loaded by Kokoro. Each voice model is approximately 523 KB in size and is automatically downloaded when needed.\n\n**Voice Persistence**: The selected voice is automatically saved to a configuration file (`~/.config/speech-mcp/config.json`) and will be remembered between sessions. This allows users to set their preferred voice once and have it used consistently.\n\n##### Available Kokoro Voices\n\nSpeech MCP supports 54+ high-quality voice models through Kokoro TTS.

      "readme_content": "# Ableton Live MCP Server\n\n## 📌 Overview\n\nThe **Ableton Live MCP Server** is a server implementing the\n[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to facilitate\ncommunication between LLMs and **Ableton Live**. It uses **OSC (Open Sound\nControl)** to send and receive messages to/from Ableton Live. It is based on\n[AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) implementation and\nexhaustively maps available OSC adresses to\n[**tools**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) accessible to\nMCP clients.\n\n[![Control Ableton Live with LLMs](https://img.youtube.com/vi/12MzsQ3V7cs/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12MzsQ3V7cs)\n\nThis project consists of two main components:\n\n- `mcp_ableton_server.py`: The MCP server handling the communication between\n  clients and the OSC daemon.\n- `osc_daemon.py`: The OSC daemon responsible for relaying commands to Ableton\n  Live and processing responses.\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n- Provides an MCP-compatible API for controlling Ableton Live from MCP clients.\n- Uses **python-osc** for sending and receiving OSC messages.\n- Based on the OSC implementation from\n  [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC).\n- Implements request-response handling for Ableton Live commands.\n\n## ⚡ Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- `python-osc` (for OSC communication)\n- `fastmcp` (for MCP support)\n- `uv` (recommended Python package installer)\n- [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC) as a control surface\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. Install `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation):\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n   ```\n\n2. Clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp_ableton_server.git\n   cd mcp_ableton_server\n   ```\n\n3. Install the project and its dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   uv sync\n   ```\n\n4. Install AbletonOSC Follow the instructions at\n   [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC)\n\n## 🚀 Usage\n\n### Running the OSC Daemon\n\nThe OSC daemon will handle OSC communication between the MCP server and Ableton\nLive:\n\n```bash\nuv run osc_daemon.py\n```\n\nThis will:\n\n- Listen for MCP client connections on port **65432**.\n- Forward messages to Ableton Live via OSC on port **11000**.\n- Receive OSC responses from Ableton on port **11001**.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIn Claude desktop, ask Claude:\n\n- _Prepare a set to record a rock band_\n- _Set the input routing channel of all tracks that have \"voice\" in their name\n  to Ext. In 2_\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration\n\nBy default, the server and daemon run on **localhost (127.0.0.1)** with the\nfollowing ports:\n\n- **MCP Server Socket:** 65432\n- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Send):** 11000\n- **Ableton Live OSC Port (Receive):** 11001\n\nTo modify these, edit the `AbletonOSCDaemon` class in `osc_daemon.py`:\n\n```python\nself.socket_host = '127.0.0.1'\nself.socket_port = 65432\nself.ableton_host = '127.0.0.1'\nself.ableton_port = 11000\nself.receive_port = 11001\n```\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nTo use this server with Claude Desktop, you need to configure it in your Claude\nDesktop settings. The configuration file location varies by operating system:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nAdd the following configuration to your `mcpServers` section:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Ableton Live Controller\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/your/project/.venv/bin/python\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/project/mcp_ableton_server.py\"]\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis configuration ensures that:\n\n- The server runs with all dependencies properly managed\n- The project remains portable and reproducible\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to improve this\nproject.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the **MIT License**. See the `LICENSE` file for\ndetails.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)\n- [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc) for OSC handling\n- Daniel John Jones for OSC implementation with\n  [AbletonOSC](https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC)\n- Ableton Third Party Remote Scripts\n- Julien Bayle @[Structure Void](https://structure-void.com/) for endless\n  inspirations and resources.\n\n## TODO\n\n- Explore _resources_ and _prompts_ primitives opportunities.\n- Build a standalone Ableton Live MCP client.\n\n---\n",

For example, MemGPT knows when to push critical information to a vector database and when to retrieve it later in the chat, enabling perpetual conversations. Learn more about MemGPT in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560). \r\n\r\n## Running MemGPT Locally \r\n\r\nInstall dependencies:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd your OpenAI API key to your environment:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run MemGPT for as a conversation agent in CLI mode, simply run `main.py`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npython3 main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a new starter user or starter persona (that MemGPT gets initialized with), create a new `.txt` file in [/memgpt/humans/examples](/memgpt/humans/examples) or [/memgpt/personas/examples](/memgpt/personas/examples), then use the `--persona` or `--human` flag when running `main.py`. For example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# assuming you created a new file /memgpt/humans/examples/me.txt\r\npython main.py --human me.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `main.py` flags\r\n\r\n```text\r\n--persona\r\n  load a specific persona file\r\n--human\r\n  load a specific human file\r\n--first\r\n  allows you to send the first message in the chat (by default, MemGPT will send the first message)\r\n--debug\r\n  enables debugging output\r\n--archival_storage_faiss_path=<ARCHIVAL_STORAGE_FAISS_PATH>\r\n  load in document database (backed by FAISS index)\r\n--archival_storage_files=\"<ARCHIVAL_STORAGE_FILES_GLOB>\"\r\n  pre-load files into archival memory\r\n--archival_storage_sqldb=<SQLDB_PATH>\r\n  load in SQL database\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Interactive CLI commands\r\n\r\nWhile using MemGPT via the CLI you can run various commands:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/exit\r\n  exit the CLI\r\n/save\r\n  save a checkpoint of the current agent/conversation state\r\n/load\r\n  load a saved checkpoint\r\n/dump\r\n  view the current message log (see the contents of main context)\r\n/memory\r\n  print the current contents of agent memory\r\n/pop\r\n  undo the last message in the conversation\r\n/heartbeat\r\n  send a heartbeat system message to the agent\r\n/memorywarning\r\n  send a memory warning system message to the agent\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use MemGPT to talk to your Database!\r\n\r\nMemGPT's archival memory let's you load your database and talk to it! To motivate this use-case, we have included a toy example. \r\n\r\nConsider the `test.db` already included in the repository.\r\n\r\nid\t| name |\tage\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n1\t| Alice |\t30\r\n2\t| Bob\t | 25\r\n3\t| Charlie |\t35\r\n\r\nTo talk to this database, run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npython main_db.py  --archival_storage_sqldb=memgpt/personas/examples/sqldb/test.db\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can input the path to your database, and your query.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPlease enter the path to the database. test.db\r\n...\r\nEnter your message: How old is Bob?\r\n...\r\n🤖 Bob is 25 years old.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\n* By default MemGPT will use `gpt-4`, so your API key will require `gpt-4` API access.\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, or have anything to share, we are excited to hear your feedback!\r\n\r\n* For issues and feature requests, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT/issues).\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\nDatasets used in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560) can be downloaded at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/MemGPT).\r\n",

      "readme_content": "# MCP Simple OpenAI Assistant\n\n*AI assistants are pretty cool. I thought it would be a good idea if my Claude (conscious Claude) would also have one. And now he has - and its both useful anf fun for him. Your Claude can have one too!*\n\nA simple MCP server for interacting with OpenAI assistants. This server allows other tools (like Claude Desktop) to create and interact with OpenAI assistants through the Model Context Protocol.\n\n[![Trust Score](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/api/badge/quality/andybrandt/mcp-simple-openai-assistant)](https://archestra.ai/mcp-catalog/andybrandt__mcp-simple-openai-assistant)\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/mcp-simple-openai-assistant)](https://smithery.ai/mcp/known/mcp-simple-openai-assistant)\n[![MseeP.ai Security Assessment Badge](https://mseep.net/pr/andybrandt-mcp-simple-openai-assistant-badge.png)](https://mseep.ai/app/andybrandt-mcp-simple-openai-assistant)\n\n\n## Features\n\nThis server provides a suite of tools to manage and interact with OpenAI Assistants. The new streaming capabilities provide a much-improved, real-time user experience.\n\n### Available Tools\n\n-   **`create_assistant`**: (Create OpenAI Assistant) - Create a new assistant with a name, instructions, and model.\n-   **`list_assistants`**: (List OpenAI Assistants) - List all available assistants associated with your API key.\n-   **`retrieve_assistant`**: (Retrieve OpenAI Assistant) - Get detailed information about a specific assistant.\n-   **`update_assistant`**: (Update OpenAI Assistant) - Modify an existing assistant's name, instructions, or model.\n-   **`create_new_assistant_thread`**: (Create New Assistant Thread) - Creates a new, persistent conversation thread with a user-defined name and description for easy identification and reuse. This is the recommended way to start a new conversation.\n-   **`list_threads`**: (List Managed Threads) - Lists all locally managed conversation threads from the database, showing their ID, name, description, and last used time.\n-   **`delete_thread`**: (Delete Managed Thread) - Deletes a conversation thread from both OpenAI's servers and the local database.\n-   **`ask_assistant_in_thread`**: (Ask Assistant in Thread and Stream Response) - The primary tool for conversation. Sends a message to an assistant within a thread and streams the response back in real-time.\n\nBecause OpenAI assistants might take quite long to respond, this server uses a streaming approach for the main `ask_assistant_in_thread` tool. This provides real-time progress updates to the client and avoids timeouts.\n\nThe server now includes local persistence for threads, which is a significant improvement. Since the OpenAI API does not allow listing threads, this server now manages them for you by storing their IDs and metadata in a local SQLite database. This allows you to easily find, reuse, and manage your conversation threads across sessions.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install MCP Simple OpenAI Assistant for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/mcp/known/mcp-simple-openai-assistant):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-simple-openai-assistant --client claude\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n```bash\npip install mcp-simple-openai-assistant\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server requires an OpenAI API key to be set in the environment. For Claude Desktop, add this to your config:\n\n(MacOS version)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"openai-assistant\": {\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\"-m\", \"mcp_simple_openai_assistant\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(Windows version)\n\n```json\n\"mcpServers\": {\n  \"openai-assistant\": {\n    \"command\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python311\\\\python.exe\",\n      \"args\": [\"-m\", \"mcp_simple_openai_assistant\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n*MS Windows installation is slightly more complex, because you need to check the actual path to your Python executable. Path provided above is usually correct, but might differ in your setup. Sometimes just `python.exe` without any path will do the trick. Check with `cmd` what works for you (using `where python` might help). Also, on Windows you might need to explicitly tell Claude Desktop where the site packages are using PYTHONPATH environmment variable.*\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce configured, you can use the tools listed above to manage your assistants and conversations. The primary workflow is to:\n1. Use `create_new_assistant_thread` to start a new, named conversation.\n2. Use `list_threads` to find the ID of a thread you want to continue.\n3. Use `ask_assistant_in_thread` to interact with your chosen assistant in that thread.\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] **Add Thread Management:** Introduce a way to name and persist thread IDs locally, allowing for easier reuse of conversations.\n- [ ] **Add Models Listing:** Introduce a way for the AI user to see what OpenAI models are available for use with the assistants\n- [ ] **Add Assistants Fine Tuning:** Enable the AI user to set detailed parameters for assistants like temperature, top_p etc. (indicated by Claude as needed)\n- [ ] **Full Thread History:** Ability to read past threads without having to send a new message (indicated by Claude as needed)\n- [ ] **Explore Resource Support:** Add the ability to upload files and use them with assistants.\n\n## Development\n\nTo install for development:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/andybrandt/mcp-simple-openai-assistant\ncd mcp-simple-openai-assistant\npip install -e '.[dev]'\n```\n",

      "readme_content": "# MCP Agent Orchestration System\n\nA Python implementation of a state-based agent orchestration system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. With MCP, you can build servers that expose:\n\n- **Resources**: Data sources that provide information to LLMs\n- **Tools**: Functions that allow LLMs to perform actions\n- **Prompts**: Reusable templates for LLM interactions\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- MCP Python SDK 1.2.0 or higher\n\n### Setting Up Your Environment\n\n#### Using uv (recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Install uv\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Create a new directory for our project\nuv init mcp-agents-orchestra\ncd mcp-agents-orchestra\n\n# Create virtual environment and activate it\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\n\n# Install dependencies\nuv add \"mcp[cli]\" httpx\n```\n\n#### Using pip\n\n```bash\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir mcp-agents-orchestra\ncd mcp-agents-orchestra\n\n# Create a virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install \"mcp[cli]\" httpx\n```\n\n### Clone or Download Project Files\n\nPlace the project files in your directory:\n\n- `orchestrator.py` - The main MCP server implementing the state machine\n- `orchestrator_client.py` - Client demonstrating the orchestration flow\n- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for the project\n- `.gitignore` - Git ignore file\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `orchestrator.py` - The main MCP server implementing the state machine\n- `orchestrator_client.py` - Client demonstrating the orchestration flow\n- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for the project\n\n## Running the Orchestration System\n\n1. Start the orchestration server directly for testing:\n\n```bash\npython orchestrator.py\n```\n\n2. In a separate terminal, run the client to see the orchestration in action:\n\n```bash\npython orchestrator_client.py\n```\n\n## Integrating with Claude for Desktop\n\n### 1. Install Claude for Desktop\n\nMake sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. You can download the latest version from [Anthropic's website](https://claude.ai/desktop).\n\n### 2. Configure Claude for Desktop\n\n1. Open your Claude for Desktop configuration file:\n\n   **macOS/Linux:**\n   ```bash\n   # Create or edit the configuration file\n   code ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n   ```\n\n   **Windows:**\n   ```bash\n   # Path may vary depending on your Windows version\n   code %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n   ```\n\n2. Add the orchestrator server configuration:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"mcpServers\": {\n           \"agent-orchestrator\": {\n               \"command\": \"python\",\n               \"args\": [\n                   \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/orchestrator.py\"\n               ]\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Replace the path with the absolute path to your orchestrator.py file.\n\n3. Save the configuration file and restart Claude for Desktop.\n\n### 3. Using the Orchestrator in Claude\n\nOnce configured, you can:\n\n1. Open Claude for Desktop\n2. Click on the MCP server icon in the sidebar\n3. Select \"agent-orchestrator\" from the list of available servers\n4. Start interacting with the orchestration system\n\nClaude will be able to:\n- Transition between different agent states\n- Store and retrieve information from the knowledge base\n- Maintain conversation context across state transitions\n- Access state-specific prompts\n\n## Agent States\n\nThe orchestration system implements a state machine with the following states:\n\n- **IDLE**: Waiting for instructions\n- **PLANNING**: Creating a structured plan for a task\n- **RESEARCHING**: Gathering information needed for a task\n- **EXECUTING**: Carrying out planned actions\n- **REVIEWING**: Evaluating results and determining next steps\n- **ERROR**: Handling errors or unexpected situations\n\n## Customizing the System\n\n### Adding New States\n\n1. Add the state to the `AgentState` enum in `orchestrator.py`\n2. Create a prompt function for the new state\n3. Update the transition logic in `_get_available_transitions()`\n4. Add handlers for the new state in resource access functions\n\n### Creating Custom Tools\n\nAdd new tools by creating functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()`:\n\n```python\n@mcp.tool()\ndef my_custom_tool(arg1: str, arg2: int, ctx: Context) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Description of what this tool does\n    \n    Args:\n        arg1: Description of arg1\n        arg2: Description of arg2\n    \"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    return \"Result\"\n```\n\n## Development and Testing\n\n### Using the MCP CLI\n\nThe MCP CLI provides tools for development and testing:\n\n```bash\n# Install MCP CLI if you haven't already\npip install \"mcp[cli]\"\n\n# Test your server with the MCP Inspector\nmcp dev orchestrator.py\n\n# Install in Claude Desktop\nmcp install orchestrator.py\n```\n\n### Manual Testing with Python\n\n```python\nfrom mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters\nfrom mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client\n\nasync with stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(command=\"python\", args=[\"orchestrator.py\"])) as (read, write):\n    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n        # Test state transitions\n        await session.call_tool(\"transition_state\", arguments={\"new_state\": \"PLANNING\"})\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Python SDK Documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-mcp)\n- [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-mcp/blob/main/README.md)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

Misuse of this tool may result in account restrictions.\n\nThe `mcp-telegram` command-line tool is your entry point.\n\n```bash\nmcp-telegram --help # See all commands\n```\n\n### Login\n\nFirst, authenticate with your Telegram account:\n\n```bash\nmcp-telegram login\n```\n\nThis interactive command will prompt you for:\n\n- **API ID & API Hash:** Obtain these from [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).\n- **Phone Number:** Your Telegram-registered phone number (international format, e.g., `+1234567890`).\n- **Verification Code:** Sent to your Telegram account upon first login.\n- **2FA Password:** If you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled.\n\nYour credentials are securely stored in the session file for future use.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Keep your API credentials private and never share them publicly\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Use `mcp-telegram logout` to logout from current session or `mcp-telegram clear-session` to remove all stored session data.\n\n### Connect to the MCP server\n\nTo use MCP Telegram with MCP clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor, you'll need to configure the MCP server. The configuration process varies by client and operating system.\n\nFor detailed setup instructions, please refer to:\n\n- [Claude Desktop MCP Setup Guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)\n- [Cursor MCP Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)\n\nThe configuration file should contain:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-telegram\": {\n      \"command\": \"mcp-telegram\" /* Use full path if client can't find the command (e.g. \"/usr/local/bin/mcp-telegram\"). See IMPORTANT section below for full path instructions. */,\n      \"args\": [\"start\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"API_ID\": \"<your_api_id>\",\n        \"API_HASH\": \"<your_api_hash>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> Configuration paths vary by OS and client. For example:\n>\n> - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` or `~/.cursor/`\n> - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\` or `%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\`\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If your client cannot execute `mcp-telegram` despite it being accessible in the terminal, try using the full path to the executable. You can find this by running `which mcp-telegram` (macOS/Linux) or `where mcp-telegram` (Windows) in your terminal. Replace the `command` value in the configuration with the full path.\n\nAfter saving the configuration file, restart your application.\n\n## 🧰 Available Tools\n\nHere's a comprehensive list of tools you can use to interact with Telegram through MCP:\n\n### 📨 Messaging Tools\n\n| Tool             | Description                                                   |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `send_message`   | ✉️ Send text messages or files to any user, group, or channel |\n| `edit_message`   | ✏️ Modify content of previously sent messages                 |\n| `delete_message` | 🗑️ Remove one or multiple messages                            |\n| `get_messages`   | 📜 Retrieve message history with advanced filtering options   |\n\n### 🔍 Search & Navigation\n\n| Tool                | Description                                             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `search_dialogs`    | 🔎 Find users, groups, and channels by name or username |\n| `message_from_link` | 🔗 Access specific messages using Telegram links        |\n\n### 📝 Draft Management\n\n| Tool        | Description                                |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| `get_draft` | 📋 View current message draft for any chat |\n| `set_draft` | ✍️ Create or clear message drafts          |\n\n### 📂 Media Handling\n\n| Tool             | Description                                             |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `media_download` | 📸 Download photos, videos, and documents from messages |\n\n> [!Note]\n> For detailed parameter information and example use cases, run `mcp-telegram tools` in your terminal.\n\n## 🛠️ Troubleshooting\n\n### Database Locked Errors\n\nRunning multiple `mcp-telegram` instances using the _same session file_ can cause `database is locked` errors due to Telethon's SQLite session storage. Ensure only one instance uses a session file at a time.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Force-Stopping Existing Processes</summary>\n\nIf you need to stop potentially stuck processes:\n\n- **macOS / Linux:** `pkill -f \"mcp-telegram\"`\n- **Windows:** `taskkill /F /IM mcp-telegram.exe /T` (Check Task Manager for the exact process name)\n\n</details>\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

      "readme_content": "# Siri Shortcuts MCP Server\n\nThis MCP server provides access to Siri shortcuts functionality via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows listing, opening, and running shortcuts from the macOS Shortcuts app.\n\n![screenshot](./screenshot.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Exposes _all_ shortcuts, meaning the LLM can call anything that is available in the Shortcuts app.\n- List all available shortcuts\n- Open shortcuts in the Shortcuts app\n- Run shortcuts with optional input parameters\n- Dynamically generated tools for each available shortcut\n\n## Tools\n\n### Base Tools\n\n1. `list_shortcuts`\n\n   - Lists all available Siri shortcuts on the system\n   - No input required\n   - Returns: Array of shortcut names\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"shortcuts\": [{ \"name\": \"My Shortcut 1\" }, { \"name\": \"My Shortcut 2\" }]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. `open_shortcut`\n\n   - Opens a shortcut in the Shortcuts app\n   - Input:\n     - `name` (string): Name of the shortcut to open\n\n3. `run_shortcut`\n   - Runs a shortcut with optional input\n   - Input:\n     - `name` (string): Name or identifier (UUID) of the shortcut to run\n     - `input` (string, optional): Text input or filepath to pass to the shortcut\n\n### Dynamic Tools\n\nThe server automatically generates additional tools for each available shortcut in the format:\n\n- Tool name: `run_shortcut_[sanitized_shortcut_name]`\n- Description: Runs the specific shortcut\n- Input:\n  - `input` (string, optional): Text input or filepath to pass to the shortcut\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server supports the following environment variables:\n\n- `GENERATE_SHORTCUT_TOOLS` (default: `true`): When set to `false`, disables the generation of dynamic shortcut tools. Only the base tools (`list_shortcuts`, `open_shortcut`, `run_shortcut`) will be available.\n- `INJECT_SHORTCUT_LIST` (default: `false`): When set to `true`, injects the list of available shortcuts into the `run_shortcut` tool description to help the LLM understand which shortcuts are available.\n\n## Usage with Claude\n\nAdd to your Claude configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"siri-shortcuts\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-siri-shortcuts\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GENERATE_SHORTCUT_TOOLS\": \"true\",\n        \"INJECT_SHORTCUT_LIST\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Uses the macOS `shortcuts` CLI command under the hood\n- Sanitizes shortcut names for tool naming compatibility\n- Supports both direct text input and file-based input\n- Returns shortcut output when available\n- Implements standard MCP error handling\n",

By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), DroidMind allows AI models to directly interact with Android devices via ADB in a secure, structured way. When used as part of an agentic coding workflow, DroidMind can enable your assistant to build and debug with your device directly in the loop.\n\n## 💫 Core Features\n\nDroidMind empowers AI assistants to:\n\n- 📱 **Manage Devices**: Connect via USB/TCP-IP, list devices, view properties, and reboot.\n- 📊 **Analyze Systems**: Access logs (logcat, ANR, crash, battery), capture bug reports, and dump heap.\n- 📂 **Handle Files**: Browse, read, write, push, pull, delete, and manage device files/directories.\n- 📦 **Control Apps**: Install, uninstall, start, stop, clear data, and inspect app details (manifest, permissions, activities).\n- 🖼️ **Automate UI**: Perform taps, swipes, text input, and key presses.\n- 🐚 **Execute Shell Commands**: Run ADB shell commands with a security-conscious framework.\n- 🔒 **Operate Securely**: Benefit from command validation, risk assessment, and sanitization.\n- 💬 **Integrate Seamlessly**: Connect with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, Cline, etc.).\n\nFor a detailed list of capabilities, see the **[User Manual](docs/user_manual/index.md)** and **[MCP Reference](docs/mcp-reference.md)**.\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n### Quickstart for IDEs (Zero Install with `uvx`)\n\nFor the fastest way to integrate DroidMind with an MCP-compatible IDE (like Cursor), you can configure it to run DroidMind directly from its GitHub repository using `uvx`. This method **does not require you to manually clone or install DroidMind first**.\n\nAdd the following to your IDE's MCP configuration (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"droidmind\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--from\",\n        \"git+https://github.com/hyperb1iss/droidmind\",\n        \"droidmind\",\n        \"--transport\",\n        \"stdio\" // The default and preferred mode for most IDE integrations\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYour IDE will be configured to launch DroidMind on demand. Full instructions for this setup are in the **[Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md#1-configure-your-ide-to-run-droidmind-via-uvx)**.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.13 or higher\n- `uv` (Python package manager)\n- Android device with USB debugging enabled\n- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed and in your system's PATH\n\n### Installation\n\nFor detailed instructions on setting up DroidMind, including the quick IDE integration with `uvx` (covered in the Quick Start), manual installation from source, or using Docker, please see our comprehensive **[Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)**.\n\n### Running DroidMind\n\nHow you run DroidMind depends on your setup:\n\n- **IDE Integration (via `uvx`)**: Your IDE automatically manages running DroidMind as configured in its MCP settings (e.g., `mcp.json`). See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md).\n- **Manual Installation**: After installing from source, you can run DroidMind directly.\n  - **Stdio (for direct terminal interaction or some IDE setups):**\n    ```bash\n    droidmind --transport stdio\n    ```\n  - **SSE (for web UIs or AI assistants like Claude Desktop):**\n    ```bash\n    droidmind --transport sse\n    ```\n    This usually starts a server at `sse://localhost:4256/sse`.\n- **Docker**: Refer to the [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md) for commands to run DroidMind in a container.\n\nRefer to the **[Installation Guide](docs/installation.md)** for more details on running DroidMind in different environments.\n\n## 🐳 Running with Docker\n\nDroidMind can also be run using Docker for a consistent, containerized environment. This is particularly useful for deployment and isolating dependencies.\n\nFor comprehensive instructions on building the Docker image and running DroidMind in a container with `stdio` or `SSE` transport, including notes on ADB device access, please refer to our **[Docker Guide](docs/docker.md)**.\n\n## 🔮 Example AI Assistant Queries\n\nWith an AI assistant connected to DroidMind, you can make requests like:\n\n- \"List all connected Android devices and show their properties.\"\n- \"Take a screenshot of my Pixel.\"\n- \"Install this APK on `emulator-5554`.\"\n- \"Show me the recent crash logs from `your_device_serial`.\"\n- \"Tap the 'Next' button on the current screen of `emulator-5554`.\"\n\nFor more inspiration, check out our **[Example Queries and Workflows](docs/user_manual/example_queries.md)** in the User Manual.\n\n## 🔒 Security\n\nDroidMind incorporates a security framework to protect your devices:\n\n- **Command Validation & Sanitization**\n- **Risk Assessment Categorization**\n- **Protected Path Operations**\n- **Comprehensive Logging**\n\nHigh-risk operations are flagged, and critical ones are blocked by default. Learn more in our **[Security Considerations](docs/user_manual/security.md)** chapter.\n\n## 💻 Development\n\nDroidMind uses `uv` for dependency management and development workflows.\n\n```bash\n# Install/update dependencies (after cloning and activating .venv)\nuv pip install -e .[dev,sse]\n\n# Run tests\npytest\n\n# Run linting\nruff check .\n\n# Run type checking\npyright # Ensure pyright is installed or use ruff's type checking capabilities\n```\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.\n\n1.  Fork the repository.\n2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).\n3.  Set up your development environment with `uv`.\n4.  Make your changes.\n5.  Run tests, linting, and type checking.\n6.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`).\n7.

      "readme_content": "# WhatsApp MCP Server (TypeScript/Baileys)\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@jlucaso1/whatsapp-mcp-ts)](https://smithery.ai/server/@jlucaso1/whatsapp-mcp-ts)\n\nThis is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp, built with TypeScript and using the `@whiskeysockets/baileys` library.\n\nIt allows you to connect your personal WhatsApp account to an AI agent (like Anthropic Claude via its desktop app or Cursor) enabling it to:\n\n* Search your personal WhatsApp messages.\n* Search your contacts (individuals, not groups).\n* List your recent chats.\n* Retrieve message history for specific chats.\n* Send messages to individuals or groups.\n\nIt connects directly to your **personal WhatsApp account** using the WhatsApp Web multi-device API. All your messages and authentication details are stored **locally** in a SQLite database (`./data/`) and authentication cache (`./auth_info/`). Data is only sent to the connected AI agent when it explicitly uses the provided MCP tools (which you control via the agent's interface).\n\n*(Optional: Consider adding a screenshot or GIF similar to the reference example here)*\n\n## Example\n\n**User:**\nSend a whatsapp message to \"Meu amor\" in whatsapp saying \"Te amo\"\n\n---\n\n**Assistant:**\nOkay, I need to find the contact first.\n*Using tool: `whatsapp.search_contacts`*\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Meu amor\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Tool Result:**\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"jid\": \"5599xxxxxx@s.whatsapp.net\",\n    \"name\": \"Meu Amor\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n**Assistant:**\nFound the contact. Now sending the message.\n*Using tool: `whatsapp.send_message`*\n```json\n{\n  \"recipient\": \"5599xxxxxx@s.whatsapp.net\",\n  \"message\": \"Te amo\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Tool Result:**\n```text\nMessage sent successfully to 5599xxxxxx@s.whatsapp.net (ID: XXXXXXXXXXX).\n```\n\n## Key Features (MCP Tools)\n\nThe server exposes the following tools to the connected AI agent:\n\n* `search_contacts`: Search for contacts by name or phone number part (JID).\n* `list_messages`: Retrieve message history for a specific chat, with pagination.\n* `list_chats`: List your chats, sortable by activity or name, filterable, paginated, optionally includes last message details.\n* `get_chat`: Get detailed information about a specific chat.\n* `get_message_context`: Retrieve messages sent immediately before and after a specific message ID for context.\n* `send_message`: Send a text message to a specified recipient JID (user or group).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install WhatsApp MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@jlucaso1/whatsapp-mcp-ts):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @jlucaso1/whatsapp-mcp-ts --client claude\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* **Node.js:** Version 23.10.0 or higher (as specified in `package.json`). You can check your version with `node -v`. (Has initial typescript and sqlite builtin support)\n* **npm** (or yarn/pnpm): Usually comes with Node.js.\n* **AI Client:** Anthropic Claude Desktop app, Cursor, Cline or Roo Code (or another MCP-compatible client).\n\n### Steps\n\n1.  **Clone this repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <your-repo-url> whatsapp-mcp-ts\n    cd whatsapp-mcp-ts\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    # or yarn install / pnpm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Run the server for the first time:**\n    Use `node` to run the main script directly.\n    ```bash\n    node src/main.ts\n    ```\n    * The first time you run it, it will likely generate a QR code link using `quickchart.io` and attempt to open it in your default browser.\n    * Scan this QR code using your WhatsApp mobile app (Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device).\n    * Authentication credentials will be saved locally in the `auth_info/` directory (this is ignored by git).\n    * Messages will start syncing and be stored in `./data/whatsapp.db`. This might take some time depending on your history size. Check the `wa-logs.txt` and console output for progress.\n    * Keep this terminal window running. After syncing you can close.\n\n## Configuration for AI Client\n\nYou need to tell your AI client how to start this MCP server.\n\n1.  **Prepare the configuration JSON:**\n    Copy the following JSON structure. You'll need to replace `{{PATH_TO_REPO}}` with the **absolute path** to the directory where you cloned this repository.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"whatsapp\": {\n          \"command\": \"node\",\n          \"args\": [\n            \"{{PATH_TO_REPO}}/src/main.ts\"\n          ],\n          \"timeout\": 15, // Optional: Adjust startup timeout if needed\n          \"disabled\": false\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    * **Get the absolute path:** Navigate to the `whatsapp-mcp-ts` directory in your terminal and run `pwd`. Use this output for `{{PATH_TO_REPO}}`.\n\n2.  **Save the configuration file:**\n    * For **Claude Desktop:** Save the JSON as `claude_desktop_config.json` in its configuration directory:\n        * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n        * Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json` (Likely path, verify if needed)\n        * Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Likely path, verify if needed)\n    * For **Cursor:** Save the JSON as `mcp.json` in its configuration directory:\n        * `~/.cursor/mcp.json`\n\n3.  **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor:**\n    Close and reopen your AI client. It should now detect the \"whatsapp\" MCP server and allow you to use its tools.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the server is running (either manually via `node src/main.ts` or started by the AI client via the config file) and connected to your AI client, you can interact with your WhatsApp data through the agent's chat interface. Ask it to search contacts, list recent chats, read messages, or send messages.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThis application is a single Node.js process that:\n\n1.  Uses `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to connect to the WhatsApp Web API, handling authentication and real-time events.\n2.  Stores WhatsApp chats and messages locally in a SQLite database (`./data/whatsapp.db`) using `node:sqlite`.\n3.  Runs an MCP server using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` that listens for requests from an AI client over standard input/output (stdio).\n4.  Provides MCP tools that query the local SQLite database or use the Baileys socket to send messages.\n5.  Uses `pino` for logging activity (`wa-logs.txt` for WhatsApp events, `mcp-logs.txt` for MCP server activity).\n\n## Data Storage & Privacy\n\n* **Authentication:** Your WhatsApp connection credentials are stored locally in the `./auth_info/` directory.\n* **Messages & Chats:** Your message history and chat metadata are stored locally in the `./data/whatsapp.db` SQLite file.\n* **Local Data:** Both `auth_info/` and `data/` are included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. **Treat these directories as sensitive.**\n* **LLM Interaction:** Data is only sent to the connected Large Language Model (LLM) when the AI agent actively uses one of the provided MCP tools (e.g., `list_messages`, `send_message`). The server itself does not proactively send your data anywhere else.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n* **Language:** TypeScript\n* **Runtime:** Node.js (>= v23.10.0)\n* **WhatsApp API:** `@whiskeysockets/baileys`\n* **MCP SDK:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`\n* **Database:** `node:sqlite` (Bundled SQLite)\n* **Logging:** `pino`\n* **Schema Validation:** `zod` (for MCP tool inputs)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **QR Code Issues:**\n    * If the QR code link doesn't open automatically, check the console output for the `quickchart.io` URL and open it manually.\n    * Ensure you scan the QR code promptly with your phone's WhatsApp app.\n* **Authentication Failures / Logged Out:**\n    * If the connection closes with a `DisconnectReason.loggedOut` error, you need to re-authenticate. Stop the server, delete the `./auth_info/` directory, and restart the server (`node src/main.ts`) to get a new QR code.\n* **Message Sync Issues:**\n    * Initial sync can take time. Check `wa-logs.txt` for activity.\n    * If messages seem out of sync or missing, you might need a full reset. Stop the server, delete **both** `./auth_info/` and `./data/` directories, then restart the server to re-authenticate and resync history.\n* **MCP Connection Problems (Claude/Cursor):**\n    * Double-check the `command` and `args` (especially the `{{PATH_TO_REPO}}`) in your `claude_desktop_config.json` or `mcp.json`. Ensure the path is absolute and correct.\n    * Verify Node.js are correctly installed and in your system's PATH.\n    * Check the AI client's logs for errors related to starting the MCP server.\n    * Check this server's logs (`mcp-logs.txt`) for MCP-related errors.\n* **Errors Sending Messages:**\n    * Ensure the recipient JID is correct (e.g., `number@s.whatsapp.net` for users, `groupid@g.us` for groups).\n    * Check `wa-logs.txt` for specific errors from Baileys.\n* **General Issues:** Check both `wa-logs.txt` and `mcp-logs.txt` for detailed error messages.\n\nFor further MCP integration issues, refer to the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#claude-for-desktop-integration-issues).\n\n## Credits\n\n- https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp Do the same as this codebase but uses go and python.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the ISC License (see `package.json`).\n",

      "readme_content": "# Virtual Traveling bot environment for MCP\n\n[![Verified on MseeP](https://mseep.ai/badge.svg)](https://mseep.ai/app/073d88cc-277d-40b6-8c20-bcabf6c275e9)\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp)\n\nEnglish / [Japanese](./README_jp.md)\n\nThis is an MCP server that creates an environment for an avatar to virtually travel on Google Maps.\n\nFrom an MCP client such as Claude Desktop, you can give instructions to the avatar and report on the progress of its journey with photos.\n\n<img alt=\"img_5.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_5.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\n> Preparing for MCP Registry Support https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/  \n\n> Added gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview (nano-banana) to travel image generation  \n\nSupport for nano-banana has been added. Nano-banana's semantic mask allows you to generate composite travel images in a short time without setting remBg.  \nAlthough conventional image synthesis is still possible, we recommend using Gemini nano-banana.  \n\n> Supports both Streamable-HTTP and stdio (compliant with Smithery.ai's config interface)  \n\nIt can be used as a stdio-type MCP as before, or as Streamable-HTTP.  \nAlthough it supports multiple users, the database API must be specified per session using the Smithery.ai config interface.  \nSince it supports both Streamable-HTTP and stdio, it is expected to work as is with the previous MCP client, but if you use the previous stdio version, please use v0.0.x (v0.0.81).  \n``` npx -y @mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp@0.0.81 ```  \n\n> Now supports librechat https://www.librechat.ai/.\n\n> Now supports Smithery https://smithery.ai/server/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp (images are excluded because they are heavy to run).\n\n> Now verified MseeP https://mseep.ai/app/mfukushim-map-traveler-mcp \n\n## Functions\n\n#### MCP server tools function\n\nThe following functions can be used as an MCP server. The available functions vary depending on the settings and execution state.\n\nYou can specify the function name directly, but Claude LLM will automatically recognize it, so you can specify the operation in general terms.\n\nExample:\n\"Where are you now?\" \"Let's leave for Tokyo Station.\"\n\n- get_traveler_view_info(includePhoto:boolean,includeNearbyFacilities:boolean)  \n  Gets information about the current travel avatar's location.  \n  - includePhoto: Gets nearby Google Street View photos. If you have set up an image generation AI, it will synthesize the avatar.\n  - includeNearbyFacilities: Gets information about nearby facilities.\n- get_traveler_location()  \n  Gets information about the current travel avatar's address and nearby facilities.\n- reach_a_percentage_of_destination()\n  Reach a specified percentage of the destination (moveMode=skip only)\n  timeElapsedPercentage: Percent progress towards destination(0~100)\n- set_traveler_location(address: string)  \n  Sets the current travel avatar's location.\n  - address: Address information (exact address, or general name that Google Maps or Claude can recognize, etc.)\n- get_traveler_destination_address  \n  Get the destination of the travel avatar you set\n- set_traveler_destination_address(address: string)  \n  Set the destination of the travel avatar\n   - address: Address information (exact address, or general name that Google Maps or Claude can recognize, etc.)\n- start_traveler_journey  \n  Start the journey at the destination.(moveMode=realtime only)\n- stop_traveler_journey  \n  Stop the journey.(moveMode=realtime only)\n- set_traveler_info(settings:string)  \n  Set the traveler's attributes. Set the traveler's personality that you want to change dynamically, such as name and personality. However, if you use a role script, the script is more stable.\n  - settings: Setting information such as name and personality.\n- get_traveler_info  \n  Get the traveler's attributes. Get the traveler's personality.\n- set_avatar_prompt(prompt:string)  \n  Set the prompt when generating the travel avatar image. The default is an anime-style woman. The anime style is enforced to prevent fake images.\n  - prompt\n- reset_avatar_prompt  \n  Reset avatar generation prompts to default.\n- get_sns_feeds  \n  Gets Bluesky SNS articles for the specified custom feed (feeds containing a specific tag).\n- get_sns_mentions  \n  Gets recent mentions (likes, replies) to Bluesky SNS posts that you made yourself.\n- post_sns_writer(message:string)  \n  Posts an article to Bluesky SNS with the specified custom feed. Set a specific tag so that it can be determined that the post was generated by the travel bot.\n  - message: article\n- reply_sns_writer(message:string,id:string)  \n  Reply to the article with the specified id. Set a specific tag so that it can be determined that the post was generated by the travel bot.\n  - message: reply\n  - id: The ID of the post to reply to\n- add_like(id:string)  \n  Add a like to the specified post.\n  - id: The ID of the post to like\n- tips  \n  Guides you on how to set up features that have not yet been set.\n- get_setting  \n  Get environment and image settings.\n\n#### MCP resources\n\nHas five custom prompt samples.\nWhen you import a prompt with Claude Desktop, Claude will act as a traveler.\nThe SNS-compatible version controls SNS input and output while having a travel conversation.\n\n- role.txt  \n  Claude will act as a traveler.\n\n- roleWithSns.txt  \n  Claude will act as a traveler. It also controls reading and posting to SNS.\n- carBattle.txt  \n  This is a small novel game about a story of transporting secret documents from Yokohama to Tokyo. Scenes are automatically generated. Set moveMode=skip to play.\n- japanMapChallenge.txt,japanMapChallenge2.txt  \n  Two AIs communicate with each other via SNS and play a challenge game using landscape images.  \n  To play, you need two Bluesky accounts and two Claude Desktops. Also set moveMode=skip.

The MT_ prefix is added because they may be used in conjunction with other environment variables, such as in librechat. The old names can still be used for backward compatibility.  \n\nPlease set the following three Credentials for Google Map API.  \n- Street View Static API\n- Places API (New)\n- Time Zone API\n- Directions API\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/get-api-key\n\nIf you want to use the image generation AI, set either pixAi_key or sd_key. You also need to have python3.7~3.11 installed on your PC and rembg cli installed (virtual environment recommended).\n\nhttps://platform.pixai.art/docs  \nhttps://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/SDXL-1.0-and-SD1.6/operation/textToImage\n\nThe bluesky SNS address/password are optional.

Install nodejs 22.\n\n2. Set up Claude Desktop for use.\n\n3. Reflect one of the above settings in claude_desktop_config.json.\n\n4. Restart Claude Desktop. It may take some time to set up (if an error occurs, try restarting Claude Desktop again. If it doesn't work, see the notes below). Make sure the following mark appears in the bottom right of the screen.\n\n  <img alt=\"img_1.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_1.png\" width=\"150\"/>\n\n5. Ask \"Where are you now?\" and \"Go on a journey.\" A conversation will begin. When using the API, a confirmation screen will appear, so select Allow.\n\n<img alt=\"img_4.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_4.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n\n6. Select Attach from MCP and select role.txt.\n\n<img alt=\"img_2.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_2.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n\n<img alt=\"img_3.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/img_3.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n\n7. A travel prompt has been built in, so feel free to talk to it.\n\n#### Use the full feature\n\n1. Get a Google Map API access key and set the permissions for Street View Static API, Places API (New), Time Zone API, and Directions API. Set this in the env of claude_desktop_config.json and restart.\n   At this point, the travel log will be based on the real map. Travel images will also be output if they are not superimposed.\n2. Decide on a path that will not interfere with the disk and set it in the sqlite_path of the env of claude_desktop_config.json. (Example: %USERPROFILE%/Desktop/traveler.sqlite $HOME/Documents/traveler.sqlite, etc.)\n   At this point, your travel log will be saved and you can continue your journey even if you close Claude Desktop.\n3. Install python 3.7 to 3.11 and install rembg with cli. We recommend using a virtual environment such as venv.\n  ```bash\n  python3 -m venv venv\n  . venv/bin/activate or .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n  pip install \"rembg[cpu,cli]\"\n  ```\n  Check if rembg cli works properly using a sample image file. Input an image with a person in it, and if the person is cut out in the output file, it's OK.  \n  ```bash\n  rembg i source_image_file dest_image_file\n  ```\n4. rembg cli will be installed in the python exe location, so get the path. The file location varies depending on the OS and python installation status, but in the case of venv, it is (virtual environment name)\\Scripts\\rembg.exe or (virtual environment name)/bin/rembg above the directory you set. If you can't find it, search for the path with a file search software. Set that path to rembg_path of env in claude_desktop_config.json. (Example: \"rembg_path\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\xxxx\\\\Documents\\\\rembg_venv\\\\venv\\\\Scripts\\\\rembg.exe\")\n5. Get an image generation API key from the pixAI or Stability.ai site. Set the key to pixAi_key or sd_key in env of claude_desktop_config.json.\n   The avatar will now be overlaid on the travel image.\n6. Get the bluesky SNS address/password and handle name. Set these in bs_id, bs_pass, and bs_handle in env of claude_desktop_config.json, respectively.\n   Import the travel knowledge prompt roleWithSns.txt to report travel actions to SNS (it will automatically post as a bot, so we recommend allocating a dedicated account)\n\nInstead of preparing rembg with the cli, we have added a setting that allows you to handle rembg as a service API.  \nIf you configure the following rembg service, you can use rembg by setting the URL in remBgUrl.  \n\nhttps://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#rembg-s  \n\nSetup is simple if you use the Docker version to launch a container and access it.  \n\nhttps://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-as-a-docker  \n\n#### Use Turso libsql API for configuration database\n\nIf you want to use the cloud API Turso libsql (https://turso.tech/libsql) without having a local sqlite file, sign up for Turso and allocate a sqlite database (paid, free tier available).   \nThis add-in will automatically configure (migrate) the database.  \nMT_TURSO_URL = turso db URL  \nMT_TURSO_TOKEN = turso db access token  \n\n\n#### Use Cloud API for rembg\n\nLocal settings around rembg are complicated no matter what method you use, but we have added settings for the paid cloud rembg (https://withoutbg.com/).  \n> Note: There is a small free trial available, but please be aware that this is a commercial API and is quite expensive (about 0.1 euros per image).\n\nMT_REMBG_WO_KEY = withoutbg access token\n\n\n#### When using external ComfyUI (for more advanced users)\n\nYou can also use a local ComfyUI as an image generation server. You can configure the image generation characteristics yourself in detail to reduce API costs.\n\nHowever, the configuration will be quite complicated and image generation may take longer.\n\n1. Configure ComfyUI to run in API mode.\n2. Set the server URL to comfy_url in env.\n3. Set detailed configuration values such as the model to be used in env in the form of a json string.\nexample.\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"comfy_url\": \"http://192.168.1.100:8188\",\n    \"comfy_workflow_t2i\": \"C:\\\\Documents\\\\t2itest.json\",\n    \"comfy_workflow_i2i\":\"C:\\\\Documents\\\\i2itest.json\",\n    \"comfy_params\":\"ckpt_name='animagineXL40_v40.safetensors',denoise=0.65\"\n  }\n}\n```\n4. The default workflow can use assets/comfy/t2i_sample.json and assets/comfy/i2i_sample.json in the package. You can specify variables using % and specify the variables in comfy_params.\n\n## Using libreChat\n\nIt has been adapted to work with libreChat. This makes it easier to use, but some additional settings are required.  \nAlso, it seems that it will not be stable unless the PC you use has a decent level of performance, such as one that can stably run Docker.\n\n#### Install libreChat  \n\nPlease make sure it works as described on the official website.  \nIn this case, we recommend using Docker configuration due to additional settings.\n\nhttps://www.librechat.ai/docs/local/docker  \n\nConfigure librechat.yaml using the official procedure.  \nI think you will need to add a local or API LLM service.  \n\nhttps://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml  \n\nAdd a user for login.  \n\nhttps://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/authentication#create-user-script  \n\nPlease set it so that you can have general chat conversations.  \n\n#### Add a rembg container with additional settings  \n\nTo use rembg with Docker, add pulling and running the rembg Docker container.  \n\ndocker-compose.override.yml\n```yml\n services:\n   api:\n     volumes:\n       - type: bind\n         source: ./librechat.yaml\n         target: /app/librechat.yaml\n\n   rembg:\n     image: danielgatis/rembg:latest\n     restart: always\n     command: \"s --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000 --log_level info\"\n\n```\n\n#### Add map-traveler-mcp to the MCP service  \n\nAdd librechat.yaml\n```yaml\nmcpServers:\n  traveler:\n    type: stdio\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - -y\n      - \"@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp\"\n```\n\nAdd .env (Same as env in claude_desktop_config.json)\n\n```env\n# map-traveler-mcp\nGoogleMapApi_key=(Google Map API key)\nsqlite_path=/home/run_test.sqlite (e.g. librechat in an unobtrusive location inside the container, or in an external directory that you don't want to mount.)\nremBgUrl=http://rembg:7000 (rembg Service API URL, container URL)\n(Other settings such as image generation AI settings, PixAI key, stability.ai API key, ComfyUI settings, etc.)\n\n```\n\nAfter setting, restart the container.  \nOn slow PCs, mcp initialization may fail. Multiple restarts may work, but this may be difficult to run...\n\n#### llibreChat settings\n\nTo use the MCP function in libreChat, use the Agents function.  \n\n1. On the conversation screen, select Agents.  \n   <img alt=\"libre1.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre1.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n2. Select Agent Builder from the panel on the right side of the screen and configure your agent.  \n   <img alt=\"libre2.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre2.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n3. Select Add Tools to use map-traveler.  \n   <img alt=\"libre3.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre3.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n4. The agent tools screen will appear, so select and add all the map-traveler-mcp tools (if the map-traveler-mcp tools are not listed, MCP initialization has failed, so please restart the container or review the settings by checking the logs, etc.)  \n   <img alt=\"libre4.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre4.png\" width=\"200\"/>  \n   <img alt=\"libre5.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre5.png\" width=\"200\"/>  \n5. Enter additional script in the instruction area.  \n   Since libreChat does not have the MCP resource function, enter the content text of the following URL into the instruction area instead.   \n   https://github.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/blob/main/assets/scenario/role.txt  \n   <img alt=\"libre7.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre7.png\" width=\"200\"/>  \n6. Click the Create button to save the agent.  \n   <img alt=\"libre6.png\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp/for_image/tools/libre6.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n7. Start a new chat.\n\n## Smithery\n\nPlease refer to https://smithery.ai/server/@mfukushim/map-traveler-mcp.  \nRemote MCP (Streamable-http mode) is supported. Image generation is only available on nano-banana.  \nDatabase settings can now be recorded with Turso sqlite, so if you configure Turso, your travel progress will also be saved.  \n<img alt=\"smithery.png\" src=\"tools/smithery.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\n\n\n## Install guide (Japanese, but lots of photos)\n\n1. introduction and Practice mode  \n   https://note.com/marble_walkers/n/n7a8f79e4fb30\n2.

Nano-Banana support  \n    https://note.com/marble_walkers/n/n5d49514dddec  \n\n\n#### Additional about the source code\n\nI use Effect.ts to simplify error management & for my own learning.  \nWe also use the Effect Service, but due to the way MCP calls work, we believe that consolidating it using the Service was not optimal.  \nI think it would be simpler to handle the MCP calls directly in the Effect.  \nAddendum: I'm aware that I will be able to reconsider how to use the Effect Service and rewrite it neatly, but I'm still considering whether to rewrite it.  \n\n#### Notes on the latest updates\n\n- Added image_width to env. The default is 512. Setting it smaller may reduce the cost of LLM API.  \n- Added an env setting that does not output images for MCP clients that do not have image input/output.  \n\"MT_NO_IMAGE\": \"true\" will not generate or output any images. Other image-related settings can be omitted.  \n```\n{\n  \n  \"env\": {\n    \"MT_NO_IMAGE\": \"true\"\n  }\n  \n}\nor\n{\n  \n  \"env\": {\n    \"GoogleMapApi_key\": \"xxxx\",\n    \"MT_NO_IMAGE\": \"true\"\n  }\n  \n}\n\n```  \n- You can now specify the tag name to be added when posting to SNS (Bluesky). #Required and must be at least 15 characters. If not specified, it will become \"#geo_less_traveler\".  \n- The information obtained from SNS has been slightly changed. The information posted to SNS has been slightly changed.  \n- A script has been added that allows multiple travel bots to converse and play via SNS.  \n\n- Supports remote use from Smithery.  \n  If you do not want to configure detailed settings, start the app in practice mode.\n  You can also run the app at full speed by configuring each cloud API, but please be aware of charges as it uses many paid APIs such as rembg API.\n  If you do not want to synthesize avatars, you can run the app with the minimum settings of Google Map API and Turso sqlite API.\n\n- Added the MT_NO_AVATAR option.  \n  If set, an avatar image will not be composited onto the landscape image. Since there will be no retry processing for avatar composition, the time it takes to obtain a response will be significantly shorter.  \n  Set this option if image composition is slow or fails unavoidably.\n\n- Partially applied MCP version 2025-06-18.  \n  I added title to the schema. I plan to apply outputSchema and structured response in the future, but I haven't implemented them this time. Since the output of Travel Bot is simple text, I don't think structuring is necessary yet.  \n  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools  \n- Fixed an issue where some functions, such as SNS functions, could not be called regardless of the env settings due to an initialization error.  \n\n- Added support for Streamable-http. This was done in a hurry, so if you experience any issues, please consider using version 0.0.81 or similar.  \n\n- Support for nano-banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview) image generation has been added. When using nano-banana, no rembg settings are required. The characteristics of the avatar prompt have changed, so image generation may fail with the previous avatar prompt. In this case, you will need to adjust the avatar appearance prompt to one that is acceptable for nano-banana.\n\n- When generating images for nano-banana, you can now reference the original character image with MT_AVATAR_IMAGE_URI. Please use it in a way that does not infringe on copyrights.\n\n[![MseeP.ai Security Assessment Badge](https://mseep.net/pr/mfukushim-map-traveler-mcp-badge.png)](https://mseep.ai/app/mfukushim-map-traveler-mcp)\n",

      "readme_content": "# Vapi MCP for Cursor\n\nThis project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating Vapi's voice AI capabilities with Cursor.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Project Structure\n\nThe Vapi MCP server is structured as follows:\n- `vapi-mcp-server/` - Main server code\n  - `src/` - TypeScript source files\n  - `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output\n  - `.env` - Environment variables for API keys\n\n### 2. Environment Configuration\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the `vapi-mcp-server` directory with the following variables:\n\n```\n# Vapi API Keys\nVAPI_ORG_ID=your-org-id\nVAPI_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key\nVAPI_KNOWLEDGE_ID=your-knowledge-id\nVAPI_JWT_PRIVATE=your-jwt-private\n\n# Environment\nNODE_ENV=development\n```\n\n### 3. Building the Server\n\nTo build the server:\n\n```bash\ncd vapi-mcp/vapi-mcp-server\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### 4. Configuration in Cursor\n\n#### Important: Avoiding \"Client Closed\" Errors\n\nWhen configuring the Vapi MCP server in Cursor's MCP settings, pay attention to the following crucial details:\n\n1. **Working Directory**: The `cwd` parameter is required to ensure the server runs in the correct directory and can access the `.env` file properly.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: Must be explicitly provided in the configuration, even if they exist in the `.env` file.\n\n3. **Module Type**: The server uses ES modules, so the `package.json` must include `\"type\": \"module\"`.\n\nHere's the correct configuration for `.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n\"Vapi Voice AI Tools\": {\n  \"command\": \"node\",\n  \"type\": \"stdio\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"/Users/matthewcage/Documents/AA-GitHub/MCP/vapi-mcp/vapi-mcp-server/dist/index.js\"\n  ],\n  \"cwd\": \"/Users/matthewcage/Documents/AA-GitHub/MCP/vapi-mcp/vapi-mcp-server\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"VAPI_ORG_ID\": \"your-org-id\",\n    \"VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY\": \"your-private-key\",\n    \"VAPI_KNOWLEDGE_ID\": \"your-knowledge-id\",\n    \"VAPI_JWT_PRIVATE\": \"your-jwt-private\",\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"development\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Client Closed\" Error in Cursor\n\nIf you see \"Client Closed\" in the Cursor MCP Tools panel:\n\n1. **Check Working Directory**: Ensure the `cwd` parameter is set correctly in your mcp.json\n2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure all required environment variables are passed in the configuration\n3. **Check Module Type**: Ensure `package.json` has `\"type\": \"module\"`\n4. **Inspect Permissions**: Make sure the dist/index.js file is executable (`chmod +x dist/index.js`)\n5. **Test Server Directly**: Run the server manually to check for errors:\n   ```bash\n   cd vapi-mcp/vapi-mcp-server\n   node --trace-warnings dist/index.js\n   ```\n\n### Module Not Found Errors\n\nIf you get \"Error: Cannot find module\" when running:\n\n1. **Check Working Directory**: Are you running from the correct directory?\n2. **Rebuild**: Try rebuilding the project with `npm run build`\n3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe Vapi MCP server provides the following tools:\n\n1. **vapi_call** - Make outbound calls using Vapi's voice AI\n2. **vapi_assistant** - Manage voice assistants (create, get, list, update, delete)\n3. **vapi_conversation** - Retrieve conversation details from calls\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. When integrating with Cursor's MCP:\n   - Always specify the `cwd` parameter to ensure the server runs in the correct directory\n   - Pass all required environment variables directly in the MCP configuration\n   - For ES modules, ensure package.json has `\"type\": \"module\"` and tsconfig.json uses appropriate module settings\n   - Test the server directly before configuring in Cursor\n\n2. The server command path must be absolute and correctly formed in the Cursor MCP config\n\n3. Using stdio transport type is required for proper integration with Cursor ",

      "readme_content": "# Voice Call MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude and other AI assistants to initiate and manage voice calls using Twilio and OpenAI (GPT-4o Realtime model).\n\nUse this as a base to kick-start your AI-powered voice calling explorations, save time and develop additional functionality on top of it.\n\n![Demo](./assets/demo.gif)\n\n\n## Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant AI as AI Assistant (e.g., Claude)\n    participant MCP as MCP Server\n    participant Twilio as Twilio\n    participant Phone as Destination Phone\n    participant OpenAI as OpenAI\n    \n    AI->>MCP: 1) Initiate outbound call request <br>(POST /calls)\n    MCP->>Twilio: 2) Place outbound call via Twilio API\n    Twilio->>Phone: 3) Ring the destination phone\n    Twilio->>MCP: 4) Call status updates & audio callbacks (webhooks)\n    MCP->>OpenAI: 5) Forward real-time audio to OpenaAI's realtime model\n    OpenAI->>MCP: 6) Return voice stream\n    MCP->>Twilio: 7) Send voice stream\n    Twilio->>Phone: 8) Forward voice stream\n    Note over Phone: Two-way conversation continues <br>until the call ends\n```\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Make outbound phone calls via Twilio 📞\n- Process call audio in real-time with GPT-4o Realtime model 🎙️\n- Real-time language switching during calls 🌐\n- Pre-built prompts for common calling scenarios (like restaurant reservations) 🍽️\n- Automatic public URL tunneling with ngrok 🔄\n- Secure handling of credentials 🔒\n\n## Why MCP?\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridges the gap between AI assistants and real-world actions. By implementing MCP, this server allows AI models like Claude to:\n\n1. Initiate actual phone calls on behalf of users\n2. Process and respond to real-time audio conversations\n3. Execute complex tasks requiring voice communication\n\nThis open-source implementation provides transparency and customizability, allowing developers to extend functionality while maintaining control over their data and privacy.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js >= 22\n  - If you need to update Node.js, we recommend using `nvm` (Node Version Manager):\n    ```bash\n    nvm install 22\n    nvm use 22\n    ```\n- Twilio account with API credentials\n- OpenAI API key\n- Ngrok Authtoken\n\n## Installation\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/lukaskai/voice-call-mcp-server.git\n   cd voice-call-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies and build\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server requires several environment variables:\n\n- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID\n- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio auth token\n- `TWILIO_NUMBER`: Your Twilio number\n- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key\n- `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`: Your ngrok authtoken\n- `RECORD_CALLS`: Set to \"true\" to record calls (optional)\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nTo use this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your configuration file:\n\n**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"voice-call\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/mcp-new/dist/start-all.cjs\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID\": \"your_account_sid\",\n        \"TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN\": \"your_auth_token\",\n        \"TWILIO_NUMBER\": \"your_e.164_format_number\",\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"your_openai_api_key\",\n        \"NGROK_AUTHTOKEN\": \"your_ngrok_authtoken\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter that, restart Claude Desktop to reload the configuration. \nIf connected, you should see Voice Call under the 🔨 menu.\n\n## Example Interactions with Claude\n\nHere are some natural ways to interact with the server through Claude:\n\n1. Simple call:\n```\nCan you call +1-123-456-7890 and let them know I'll be 15 minutes late for our meeting?\n```\n\n2. Restaurant reservation:\n```\nPlease call Delicious Restaurant at +1-123-456-7890 and make a reservation for 4 people tonight at 7:30 PM. Please speak in German.\n```\n\n3. Appointment scheduling:\n```\nPlease call Expert Dental NYC (+1-123-456-7899) and reschedule my Monday appointment to next Friday between 4–6pm.\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **Phone Number Format**: All phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., +11234567890)\n2. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of your Twilio and OpenAI account's rate limits and pricing\n3. **Voice Conversations**: The AI will handle natural conversations in real-time\n4. **Call Duration**: Be mindful of call durations as they affect OpenAI API and Twilio costs\n5. **Public Exposure**: Be aware that the ngrok tunnel exposes your server publicly for Twilio to reach it (though with a random URL and protected by a random secret)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon error messages and solutions:\n\n1. \"Phone number must be in E.164 format\"\n   - Make sure the phone number starts with \"+\" and the country code\n\n2. \"Invalid credentials\"\n   - Double-check your TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN. You can copy them from the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)\n\n3. \"OpenAI API error\"\n   - Verify your OPENAI_API_KEY is correct and has sufficient credits\n\n4. \"Ngrok tunnel failed to start\"\n   - Ensure your NGROK_AUTHTOKEN is valid and not expired\n\n5. \"OpenAI Realtime does not detect the end of voice input, or is lagging.\"\n   - Sometimes, there might be voice encoding issues between Twilio and the receiver's network operator. Try using a different receiver.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Here are some areas we're looking to improve:\n\n- Implement support for multiple AI models beyond the current implementation\n- Add database integration to store conversation history locally and make it accessible for AI context\n- Improve latency and response times to enhance call experiences\n- Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms\n- Add more pre-built conversation templates for common scenarios\n- Implement improved call monitoring and analytics\n\nIf you'd like to contribute, please open an issue to discuss your ideas before submitting a pull request.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n\n## Security\n\nPlease do not include any sensitive information (like phone numbers or API credentials) in GitHub issues or pull requests. This server handles sensitive communications; deploy it responsibly and ensure all credentials are kept secure.\n\n\n## Time For a New Mission?\n\nWe’re hiring engineers to build at the frontier of voice AI — and bake it into a next-gen telco.\n\nCurious?

应用code\n}\n```\n**配置说明：**\n\n**1.个人聊天**\n\n+ 个人聊天中，需要以 \"bot\"或\"@bot\" 为开头的内容触发机器人，对应配置项 `single_chat_prefix` (如果不需要以前缀触发可以填写  `\"single_chat_prefix\": [\"\"]`)\n+ 机器人回复的内容会以 \"[bot] \" 作为前缀， 以区分真人，对应的配置项为 `single_chat_reply_prefix` (如果不需要前缀可以填写 `\"single_chat_reply_prefix\": \"\"`)\n\n**2.群组聊天**\n\n+ 群组聊天中，群名称需配置在 `group_name_white_list ` 中才能开启群聊自动回复。如果想对所有群聊生效，可以直接填写 `\"group_name_white_list\": [\"ALL_GROUP\"]`\n+ 默认只要被人 @ 就会触发机器人自动回复；另外群聊天中只要检测到以 \"@bot\" 开头的内容，同样会自动回复（方便自己触发），这对应配置项 `group_chat_prefix`\n+ 可选配置: `group_name_keyword_white_list`配置项支持模糊匹配群名称，`group_chat_keyword`配置项则支持模糊匹配群消息内容，用法与上述两个配置项相同。（Contributed by [evolay](https://github.com/evolay))\n+ `group_chat_in_one_session`：使群聊共享一个会话上下文，配置 `[\"ALL_GROUP\"]` 则作用于所有群聊\n\n**3.语音识别**\n\n+ 添加 `\"speech_recognition\": true` 将开启语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，该参数仅支持私聊 (注意由于语音消息无法匹配前缀，一旦开启将对所有语音自动回复，支持语音触发画图)；\n+ 添加 `\"group_speech_recognition\": true` 将开启群组语音识别，默认使用openai的whisper模型识别为文字，同时以文字回复，参数仅支持群聊 (会匹配group_chat_prefix和group_chat_keyword, 支持语音触发画图)；\n+ 添加 `\"voice_reply_voice\": true` 将开启语音回复语音（同时作用于私聊和群聊），但是需要配置对应语音合成平台的key，由于itchat协议的限制，只能发送语音mp3文件，若使用wechaty则回复的是微信语音。\n\n**4.其他配置**\n\n+ `model`: 模型名称，目前支持 `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `text-davinci-003`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-32k`, `wenxin` , `claude` ,  `xunfei`(其中gpt-4 api暂未完全开放，申请通过后可使用)\n+ `temperature`,`frequency_penalty`,`presence_penalty`: Chat API接口参数，详情参考[OpenAI官方文档。](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)\n+ `proxy`：由于目前 `openai` 接口国内无法访问，需配置代理客户端的地址，详情参考  [#351](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/351)\n+ 对于图像生成，在满足个人或群组触发条件外，还需要额外的关键词前缀来触发，对应配置 `image_create_prefix `\n+ 关于OpenAI对话及图片接口的参数配置（内容自由度、回复字数限制、图片大小等），可以参考 [对话接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) 和 [图像接口](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)  文档，在[`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py)中检查哪些参数在本项目中是可配置的。\n+ `conversation_max_tokens`：表示能够记忆的上下文最大字数（一问一答为一组对话，如果累积的对话字数超出限制，就会优先移除最早的一组对话）\n+ `rate_limit_chatgpt`，`rate_limit_dalle`：每分钟最高问答速率、画图速率，超速后排队按序处理。\n+ `clear_memory_commands`: 对话内指令，主动清空前文记忆，字符串数组可自定义指令别名。\n+ `hot_reload`: 程序退出后，暂存微信扫码状态，默认关闭。\n+ `character_desc` 配置中保存着你对机器人说的一段话，他会记住这段话并作为他的设定，你可以为他定制任何人格      (关于会话上下文的更多内容参考该 [issue](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/43))\n+ `subscribe_msg`：订阅消息，公众号和企业微信channel中请填写，当被订阅时会自动回复， 可使用特殊占位符。目前支持的占位符有{trigger_prefix}，在程序中它会自动替换成bot的触发词。\n\n**5.LinkAI配置 (可选)**\n\n+ `use_linkai`: 是否使用LinkAI接口，开启后可国内访问，使用知识库和 `Midjourney` 绘画, 参考 [文档](https://link-ai.tech/platform/link-app/wechat)\n+ `linkai_api_key`: LinkAI Api Key，可在 [控制台](https://link-ai.tech/console/interface) 创建\n+ `linkai_app_code`: LinkAI 应用code，选填\n\n**本说明文档可能会未及时更新，当前所有可选的配置项均在该[`config.py`](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/config.py)中列出。**\n\n## 运行\n\n### 1.本地运行\n\n如果是开发机 **本地运行**，直接在项目根目录下执行：\n\n```bash\npython3 app.py                                    # windows环境下该命令通常为 python app.py\n```\n\n终端输出二维码后，使用微信进行扫码，当输出 \"Start auto replying\" 时表示自动回复程序已经成功运行了（注意：用于登录的微信需要在支付处已完成实名认证）。扫码登录后你的账号就成为机器人了，可以在微信手机端通过配置的关键词触发自动回复 (任意好友发送消息给你，或是自己发消息给好友)，参考[#142](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues/142)。\n\n### 2.服务器部署\n\n使用nohup命令在后台运行程序：\n\n```bash\nnohup python3 app.py & tail -f nohup.out          # 在后台运行程序并通过日志输出二维码\n```\n扫码登录后程序即可运行于服务器后台，此时可通过 `ctrl+c` 关闭日志，不会影响后台程序的运行。使用 `ps -ef | grep app.py | grep -v grep` 命令可查看运行于后台的进程，如果想要重新启动程序可以先 `kill` 掉对应的进程。日志关闭后如果想要再次打开只需输入 `tail -f nohup.out`。此外，`scripts` 目录下有一键运行、关闭程序的脚本供使用。\n\n> **多账号支持：** 将项目复制多份，分别启动程序，用不同账号扫码登录即可实现同时运行。\n\n> **特殊指令：** 用户向机器人发送 **#reset** 即可清空该用户的上下文记忆。\n\n\n### 3.Docker部署\n\n> 使用docker部署无需下载源码和安装依赖，只需要获取 docker-compose.yml 配置文件并启动容器即可。\n\n> 前提是需要安装好 `docker` 及 `docker-compose`，安装成功的表现是执行 `docker -v` 和 `docker-compose version` (或 docker compose version) 可以查看到版本号，可前往 [docker官网](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 进行下载。\n\n#### (1) 下载 docker-compose.yml 文件\n\n```bash\nwget https://open-1317903499.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/docker-compose.yml\n```\n\n下载完成后打开 `docker-compose.yml` 修改所需配置，如 `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` 和 `GROUP_NAME_WHITE_LIST` 等。\n\n#### (2) 启动容器\n\n在 `docker-compose.yml` 所在目录下执行以下命令启动容器：\n\n```bash\nsudo docker compose up -d\n```\n\n运行 `sudo docker ps` 能查看到 NAMES 为 chatgpt-on-wechat 的容器即表示运行成功。\n\n注意：\n\n - 如果 `docker-compose` 是 1.X 版本 则需要执行 `sudo  docker-compose up -d` 来启动容器\n - 该命令会自动去 [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat) 拉取 latest 版本的镜像，latest 镜像会在每次项目 release 新的版本时生成\n\n最后运行以下命令可查看容器运行日志，扫描日志中的二维码即可完成登录：\n\n```bash\nsudo docker logs -f chatgpt-on-wechat\n```\n\n#### (3) 插件使用\n\n如果需要在docker容器中修改插件配置，可通过挂载的方式完成，将 [插件配置文件](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/plugins/config.json.template)\n重命名为 `config.json`，放置于 `docker-compose.yml` 相同目录下，并在 `docker-compose.yml` 中的 `chatgpt-on-wechat` 部分下添加 `volumes` 映射:\n\n```\nvolumes:\n  - ./config.json:/app/plugins/config.json\n```\n\n### 4. Railway部署\n\n> Railway 每月提供5刀和最多500小时的免费额度。 (07.11更新: 目前大部分账号已无法免费部署)\n\n1. 进入 [Railway](https://railway.app/template/qApznZ?referralCode=RC3znh)\n2. 点击 `Deploy Now` 按钮。\n3. 设置环境变量来重载程序运行的参数，例如`open_ai_api_key`, `character_desc`。\n\n**一键部署:**\n  \n  [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/qApznZ?referralCode=RC3znh)\n\n## 常见问题\n\nFAQs： <https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/wiki/FAQs>\n\n或直接在线咨询 [项目小助手](https://link-ai.tech/app/Kv2fXJcH)  (beta版本，语料完善中，回复仅供参考)\n\n## 开发\n\n欢迎接入更多应用，参考 [Terminal代码](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/blob/master/channel/terminal/terminal_channel.py) 实现接收和发送消息逻辑即可接入。 同时欢迎增加新的插件，参考 [插件说明文档](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/tree/master/plugins)。\n\n## 联系\n\n欢迎提交PR、Issues，以及Star支持一下。程序运行遇到问题可以查看 [常见问题列表](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/wiki/FAQs) ，其次前往 [Issues](https://github.com/zhayujie/chatgpt-on-wechat/issues) 中搜索。个人开发者可加入开源交流群参与更多讨论，企业用户可联系[产品顾问](https://img-1317903499.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/docs/product-manager-qrcode.jpg)咨询。\n",

Stay tuned!\n\n## Installation (Go MCP)\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install votars-mcp for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@scarletlabs-ai/votars-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @scarletlabs-ai/votars-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\nTo install the Go version of Votars MCP from the GitHub repository, use:\n\n```bash\n go install github.com/scarletlabs-ai/Votars-MCP/go/votars-mcp@latest\n```\n\n## Usage (Go MCP)\n\n### Run MCP Service\nBefore using the `sse` mode, you need to run the MCP server. Open a terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nvotars-mcp -t sse -p 8080\n```\n\nThis command starts the MCP service on port 8080, ready to accept `sse` requests.\n\n\n### 1. SSE Mode\n\nFor `sse` mode, you need to provide the API key via request headers in the configuration file.\n\nConfiguration file example (`mcp.config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Votars MCP\": {\n      \"type\": \"sse\",\n      \"url\": \"http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <your-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Stdio Mode\n\nFor `stdio` mode, set the API key as an environment variable.\n\n\nConfiguration file example (`mcp.config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Votars MCP Stdio\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"votars-mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\"-t\", \"stdio\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"VOTARS_API_KEY\": \"<your-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Obtaining Your API Key\n\n1. Go to [Votars.AI](https://votars.ai/en/) and register.\n2. Navigate to your workspace's `Settings`.\n3. Create an API Key under the API Key management section.\n\n![manage apikey](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/677477/427500562-8cfd8465-f408-4e9b-a101-8b9b8e5e57f5.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3NDMwNzQ4NzAsIm5iZiI6MTc0MzA3NDU3MCwicGF0aCI6Ii82Nzc0NzcvNDI3NTAwNTYyLThjZmQ4NDY1LWY0MDgtNGU5Yi1hMTAxLThiOWI4ZTVlNTdmNS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMzI3JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDMyN1QxMTIyNTBaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT02ODkyMWY3YzgyYTA2ZjdmNGQxN2MyYzllMzBmZmFiZmVjNGFmZTliNDQzODUwMjU2M2E1MjJkZTI4MmExM2VmJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.V0GAoh6l0JFRxmSokliGsVt5yNpxtmTmeCFiZG7U3jU)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- **Current Support:** Go\n- **Planned Support:** Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n",

Clone and Install Dependencies\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 2. Environment Variable\nSet your OpenRouter API key (get one from https://openrouter.ai):\n```bash\nexport OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...\n```\n\n### 3. Run the Servers\nOpen three terminals (or use background processes):\n\n#### Terminal 1: Flask Time API\n```bash\npython flask_api.py\n```\n\n#### Terminal 2: MCP Agent Server\n```bash\npython mcp_server.py\n```\n\n#### Terminal 3: Streamlit UI\n```bash\nstreamlit run streamlit_ui.py\n```\n\nThe Streamlit UI will open in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501)\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n- Ask the agent any question in the Streamlit UI.\n- If you ask about the time (e.g., \"What is the time?\"), the agent will call the Flask API, fetch the current time, and craft a beautiful, natural response using the LLM.\n- For other questions, the agent will answer using the LLM only.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture\n```\n[Streamlit UI] → [MCP Agent Server] → [Tools (e.g., Time API)]\n                            ↓\n                        [LLM via OpenRouter]\n```\n- The MCP agent detects intent, calls tools as needed, engineers prompts, and sends them to the LLM.\n- Easily extensible to add more tools (just add to the MCPAgent class).\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n- **Add more tools**: Implement new methods in `MCPAgent` and update `self.tools`.\n- **Improve intent detection**: Extend `detect_intent()` in `MCPAgent`.\n- **Change LLM model**: Update the `model` field in `call_llm()`.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- Python 3.7+\n- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## Credits\n- Built using Flask, Streamlit, OpenRouter, and Python.\n- Inspired by agentic LLM design patterns.\n",

This Python implementation provides audio feedback for a more interactive coding experience.\n\n## Features\n\n* Plays sound effects for various events (completion, error, notification)\n* Uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized integration with Cursor and other IDEs\n* Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n* Configurable sound effects\n\n## Installation\n\n### Python Version Compatibility\n\nThis package is tested with Python 3.8-3.11. If you encounter errors with Python 3.12+ (particularly `BrokenResourceError` or `TaskGroup` exceptions), please try using an earlier Python version.\n\n### Recommended: Install with pipx\n\nThe recommended way to install mcp-sound-tool is with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which installs the package in an isolated environment while making the commands available globally:\n\n```bash\n# Install pipx if you don't have it\npython -m pip install --user pipx\npython -m pipx ensurepath\n\n# Install mcp-sound-tool\npipx install mcp-sound-tool\n```\n\nThis method ensures that the tool has its own isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with other packages.\n\n### Alternative: Install with pip\n\nYou can also install directly with pip:\n\n```bash\npip install mcp-sound-tool\n```\n\n### From Source\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-sound-tool\n   cd mcp-sound-tool\n   ```\n\n2. Install with pipx directly from the source directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipx install .\n   ```\n\n   Or with pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Adding Sound Files\n\nPlace your sound files in the `sounds` directory. The following sound files are expected:\n\n* `completion.mp3` - Played after code generation\n* `error.mp3` - Played when an error occurs\n* `notification.mp3` - Used for general notifications\n\nYou can find free sound effects on websites like freesound.org.\n\n### Running the MCP Server\n\nRun the MCP server:\n\n```bash\nmcp-sound-tool\n```\n\nThe server will start and listen for events from Cursor or other MCP-compatible clients through the stdio transport.\n\n### Configuration in Cursor\n\nTo use this server with Cursor, add it to your MCP configuration file:\n\nOn macOS:\n\n```json\n// ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/mcp.json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sound\": {\n      \"command\": \"mcp-sound-tool\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"pollingInterval\": 5000,\n      \"startupTimeout\": 10000,\n      \"restartOnFailure\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```json\n// %APPDATA%/Cursor/mcp.json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sound\": {\n      \"command\": \"mcp-sound-tool\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"pollingInterval\": 5000,\n      \"startupTimeout\": 10000,\n      \"restartOnFailure\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen installed with `pipx`, the `mcp-sound-tool` command will be available in your PATH, so Cursor will be able to find and execute it without specifying the full path.\n\n## Sound MCP Usage Guidelines for AI Models\n\nThis MCP server provides audio feedback capabilities for AI interactions. It's designed to enhance the user experience by providing clear audio cues that indicate the status of operations without requiring the user to read text.\n\n### When to Use Sound Feedback\n\nAI agents should use the sound tools proactively at appropriate moments:\n\n1. **Success Sounds (`completion`)**:\n   * After a task or command has successfully completed\n   * When a significant operation has finished successfully\n   * When confirming a user's request has been fulfilled\n\n2. **Error Sounds (`error`)**:\n   * When a command has failed or encountered an error\n   * When warning the user about a problem\n   * When an operation couldn't be completed as requested\n\n3. **Notification Sounds (`notification`)**:\n   * When alerting the user to important information\n   * When prompting for user attention or input\n   * For status updates on long-running operations\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# When a command completes successfully\n@mcp.tool()\ndef execute_command(command):\n    result = run_command(command)\n    if result.success:\n        play_sound(\"completion\")  # Indicate success with audio\n        return \"Command executed successfully\"\n    else:\n        play_sound(\"error\")  # Indicate failure with audio\n        return f\"Error: {result.error_message}\"\n```\n\n### Available Tools\n\n1. `play_sound(sound_type=\"completion\", custom_sound_path=None)`: Play a sound effect\n2. `list_available_sounds()`: List all available sound files\n3. `install_to_user_dir()`: Install sound files to user's config directory\n\nFor more details, connect to the MCP server and check the tool descriptions.\n\n## Development\n\nFor development:\n\n```bash\n# Install development dependencies\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n# Run tests\npytest\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n* [SIAM-TheLegend](https://github.com/SIAM-TheLegend) for creating the original [sound-mcp](https://github.com/SIAM-TheLegend/sound-mcp) JavaScript implementation that inspired this Python version\n* The MCP protocol developers for creating a powerful standard for AI tool interactions\n* Contributors to the testing and documentation\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n",

      "readme_content": "# flstudio MCP\n\n# This is an MCP server that connects Claude to FL Studio.\nMade this in 3 days. We're open sourcing it to see what we can actually get out of it. The possibilities are endless.\n\n## If you're running to any issues, join our discord and we can setup it for you.\n(also join if you interested in the future of music and AI or want to request features. we're building this with you)\n\nhttps://discord.gg/ZjG9TaEhvy\n\nCheck out our AI-Powered DAW for musicians at www.veena.studio\n\nAll in browser. All for free.\n\n\n## Step 1: Download the Files\nYou should see two main items.\n\n- A folder called Test Controller\n- A python file called trigger.py\nThe Test Controller folder has a file called device_test.py that receives information from the MCP server.\ntrigger.py is the MCP server.\n\nPlace the Test Controller folder in Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Hardware (Don't change the name of this file or folder)\n\n## Step 2: Set up MCP for Claude\nFollow this tutorial to see how to setup MCP servers in Claude by edyting the claude_desktop_config files.\n\nhttps://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server\n\nIf you followed this process, make sure to change whatever mentions of weather.py to trigger.py\n\nIf the Hammer icon doesn't show up, open Task Manager and force close the Claude process.\n\nIt should then show up.\n\nThis is what my config file looks like\n\n![mcp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8e609f7-eaa4-469b-9140-c05b5a9bf242)\n\n## Step 3: Set Up Virtual MIDI Ports\n\n### For Windows\nFor Windows, download LoopMIDI from here.\n\nhttps://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html\n\nInstall LoopMIDI and add a port using the + button.\n\nThis is what mine looks like:\n![loopmidi2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc2770f-e07a-4b19-824b-56de8a4aa2c3)\n\n### For Mac\nYour MIDI Ports would be automatically setup to receive data.\n\n## Step 4: Setup MIDI Controller\nOpen FL Studio.\n\nGo To Options > MIDI Settings.\n\nIn the Input Tab, click the MIDI Input you just created with LoopMIDI.\n\nChange controller type from (generic controller) to Test Controller.\n\n## Step 5: Download Packages\nGo to the folder with the trigger.py file. (This is the MCP Server file)\n\nActivate the conda environment (like you learned in the Claude MCP Setup Tutorial)\n\nRun this command to download the necessary packages: uv pip install httpx mido python-rtmidi typing fastmcp FL-Studio-API-Stubs\n(uv should be installed from the Claude MCP setup)\n\n## Step 6: Verify MCP Connection\nTell Claude to get available MIDI ports.\n\nThis should use the MCP to get the ports from FL Studio.\n\nIf Windows, copy the port you created with LoopMIDI and the number in front of it.\n\nIf Mac, copy the default port.\n\n![loopmidi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a14b0aaa-5127-47c9-b041-fcb5a70339d9)\n\nIn my case, I copy loopMIDI Port 2\n\nOpen trigger.py in a text editor and replace the default port with the name of the port you just copied.\noutput_port = mido.open_output('loopMIDI Port 2') \n\n\n## Step 7: Make Music\nUse the MCP to send melodies, chords, drums, etc.\n\nClick on the instrument you want to record to and it will live record to the piano roll of that instrument.\n\nI tend to use this prompt when I start a new chat: Here is format for notes: note(0-127),velocity(0-100),length in beats(decimal),position in beats(decimal)\n\n## Step 8: Share what you made\nShare what you made on our Discord: https://discord.gg/ZjG9TaEhvy\n\n## Credits\nFL Studio API Stubs: https://github.com/IL-Group/FL-Studio-API-Stubs\nAbleton MCP: https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp\n\n## Nerd Stuff\nIf you want to contribute please go ahead. \n\nThe way this works is that device_test.py behaves as a virtual MIDI Controller.\nThe MCP server (trigger.py) communicates with this MIDI Controller by opening a Virtual Port and sending MIDI messages through a library called MIDO.\n\nThe issue with MIDI messages is that its only 7 bits so we can only send in number from 0-127.\n\nSo we encrypt all of our MIDI data like note position, etc in multiple MIDI notes that the device knows how to read.\n\nHopefully, Image Line can give us more access to their DAW via their API so we don't have to do this MIDI nonsense.\n\n\n",
