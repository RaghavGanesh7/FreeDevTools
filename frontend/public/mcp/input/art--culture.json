      "readme_content": "# Maya MCP\r\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Autodesk Maya\r\n\r\nTested with Maya 2023, 2025.\r\n\r\nv0.2.0\r\n\r\nThis project enables AI assistant clients like Claude Desktop to control Autodesk Maya through natural language using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). \r\n\r\nThis is early days for Maya MCP server and has a minimal set of functionality. It's really the architecture design and simplicity that has been the initial focus.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the tools registered with Maya MCP.\r\n\r\n## Basic Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| list_objects_by_type | Get a list of objects in the scene. Use filter_by to filter for certain objects such as \"cameras\", \"lights\", \"materials\", or \"shapes\". |\r\n| create_object | Create an object in the Maya scene. Object types available are cube, cone, sphere, cylinder, camera, spotLight, pointLight, directionalLight. |\r\n| get_object_attributes | Get a list of attributes on a Maya object. | \r\n| set_object_attributes | Set an object's attribute with a specific value. |\r\n| scene_new | Create a new scene in Maya. Use the force argument to force a new scene when an existing scene is loaded and has been modified. |\r\n| scene_open | Load in a scene into Maya. | \r\n| scene_save | Save the current scene. If the filename is not specified, it will save it as its current name. |\r\n| select_object | Select an object in the scene. |\r\n\r\n## Advanced Modeling Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| create_advanced_model | Create complex 3D models like cars, trees, buildings, cups, and chairs with detailed parameters. |\r\n| mesh_operations | Perform modeling operations such as extrude, bevel, subdivide, boolean, combine, bridge, and split. |\r\n| create_material | Create and assign materials with various types (lambert, phong, wood, marble, chrome, glass, etc.) |\r\n| create_curve | Generate NURBS curves for various shapes (line, circle, spiral, helix, star, gear, etc.) |\r\n| curve_modeling | Create geometry using curve-based modeling techniques (extrude, loft, revolve, sweep, etc.) |\r\n| organize_objects | Organize objects through grouping, parenting, layout, alignment, and distribution. |\r\n| generate_scene | Generate complete 3D scenes with multiple objects (city, forest, living room, office, park) |\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMaya MCP server is designed so there is only an MCP server and doesn't require anything to be installed within Maya. This is helpful since you can easily use different versions of Maya and not have to worry about coordinating version changes. This is done by taking advantage of the default Command Port Maya opens up for MEL scripting. \r\n\r\nMCP requires Python 3.10 or greater. Currently using pip as the package requirements are minimal. To install the virtual environment:\r\n\r\n1. download this project\r\n2. Create a virtual env using Python 3.10+ in the project directory. ```python -m venv .venv```\r\n3. activate the virtual environment\r\n   * Windows: ```.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat```\r\n   * Mac/Linux: ```source .venv\\bin\\activate.sh```\r\n4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```\r\n\r\nAs stated, there is nothing to install for Maya.\r\n\r\n### MCP Client Configuration\r\n\r\nDepending on which MCP Client you're using, the configuration file location differs. For [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), go to File -> Settings -> Developer Tab and press the Edit Config button. This will bring up the file finder in the directory location of the JSON config file.\r\n\r\nNext you need to edit the config JSON file by hand using a text editor.  Make sure to use full file paths.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"MayaMCP\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/.venv/Scripts/python.exe\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/src/maya_mcp_server.py\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the changes have been made, restart Claude Desktop (use Exit menu item instead of just closing the window). In the Developers Tab, you will now see the Maya MCP server listed.\r\n\r\nIn Claude Desktop, you can verify the Maya MCP tools are available. Press the ![](docs/CluadeDesktop-MCP-Tools-Available-Button.jpg) button and a detailed popup will appear.\r\n\r\n![](docs/CluadeDesktop-MCP-Tools-Available-Detailed.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Maya Communications\r\n\r\nWhen the Maya MCP server first attempts to communicate with Maya, you will get this popup within Maya. Please click \"Allow All\" to allow for ongoing communication between the MCP server and Maya. This will need to be done each Maya session.\r\n\r\n![](docs/MayaSecurityWarning-RunScript.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP Server module was designed to be easily modified in a non-intrusive way. This is done by having the Maya Python code reside in the MCP server and sent to Maya's command port for execution. The results are sent back to the server and processed.\r\n\r\nThe default Maya command port runs MEL so the Python code is modified to run within MEL function call to the Python interpreter. There is also some limits such as multi-line Python code can't have any returned results. So, each command creates two connections to Maya. First to run the operation and save the results. The second connection then to read back the results. \r\n\r\nTo help minimize populating the namespace in the Maya global Python interpreter, functions and variables sent to Maya will be scoped to start with _mcp_maya_*. Each of the Maya tools are scoped into a function named _mcp_maya_scope(). The results are assigned to the variable _mcp_maya_results. This way should significantly reduce the possibility of name collisions. \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of elegance to this design. You basically can just add the Python file, restart the MCP Client and Maya MCP server and go. You don't need to integrate the operations on both the Maya MCP server and Maya itself. The code you add is only Maya specific Python and doesn't need to add any MCP decorators. This is a much better design to grow and adapt to different installations instead of having a fixed set of tools.\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP server was built using the low-level Python MCP module. This was necessary to allow for dynamically defining all of the tools at run time. The tool function signatures are captured dynamically at the start of the server. \r\n\r\n### Adding New Tools\r\n\r\nIt is easy to add new tools to Maya MCP. You don't need to change any of the existing code. All you need to do is add a single tool command Python file to the mayatools/thirdparty directory. The tool itself will run in Maya so it will have access to all of the Maya Python modules. There are a few programmer notes in the design of the tool.\r\n\r\n* The name of the Python file and the function name must be the same. Make sure it is unique.\r\n* The Python function will be loaded by both the server and Maya. Any code outside of the function must be able to be loaded into standalone Python. Meaning any imports such as maya.cmds should be done in the scope of the function. The MCP server loads the function so it can inspect the function signature to send the information to MCP Client via JSON-RPC.\r\n* The function signature will be parsed and must include any types in the function argument annotation.\r\n* When your function is sent to Maya, it will be scoped within am _mcp_maya_scope function. This provides a number of benefits. The functions sent to Maya will not polute the Python global space too much running in Maya. Plus, any exceptions thrown will be caught and returned back to the MCP Client as errors.\r\n* Generally, you want to return either a list or dictionary or throw an exception when there is an error.\r\n* Name your function and arguments appropriately so the LLM can understand the operation. Include a function doc string.\r\n* Default arguments are good. \r\n* Error checking is good so error messages can provide better failed explanations.\r\n\r\nI recommend looking at the existing Maya tools in this project as examples.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nCurrently Maya MCP has only been tested on Windows. Should work on both Linux and Mac as everything is using standard Python.\r\n\r\n## Future Ideas\r\n\r\nIt's early days for MCP and there is a lot to improve. Here are some ideas.\r\n\r\n* Expose more functionality.\r\n* Improve using prompt engineering, particularly describing Maya's usage and data relationships.\r\n* Everything is registered as tools, allow for resources and prompts.\r\n* It could be possible to find any plugins within Maya that has MCP tools. Maybe something like looking at the PYTHONPATH within Maya with any directory named MCP. All of those could be inspected and then provided back to the MCP Client.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\r\n* [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\r\n* [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\r\n* [Unreal MCP](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important Note\r\n\r\nThis project was done on my personal time and equipment to learn about MCP.

Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal\n\n### Using with Claude\n\nOnce the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP.\n\n![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/hammer-icon.png)\n\n#### Capabilities\n\n- Get scene and object information \n- Create, delete and modify shapes\n- Apply or create materials for objects\n- Execute any Python code in Blender\n- Download the right models, assets and HDRIs through [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/)\n- AI generated 3D models through [Hyper3D Rodin](https://hyper3d.ai/)\n\n\n### Example Commands\n\nHere are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:\n\n- \"Create a low poly scene in a dungeon, with a dragon guarding a pot of gold\" [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqgKuLYUv00)\n- \"Create a beach vibe using HDRIs, textures, and models like rocks and vegetation from Poly Haven\" [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I29rn92gkC4)\n- Give a reference image, and create a Blender scene out of it [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRb03XPiRo)\n- \"Generate a 3D model of a garden gnome through Hyper3D\"\n- \"Get information about the current scene, and make a threejs sketch from it\" [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbNI5L7AH8)\n- \"Make this car red and metallic\" \n- \"Create a sphere and place it above the cube\"\n- \"Make the lighting like a studio\"\n- \"Point the camera at the scene, and make it isometric\"\n\n## Hyper3D integration\n\nHyper3D's free trial key allows you to generate a limited number of models per day. If the daily limit is reached, you can wait for the next day's reset or obtain your own key from hyper3d.ai and fal.ai.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Connection issues**: Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured on Claude, DO NOT run the uvx command in the terminal. Sometimes, the first command won't go through but after that it starts working.\n- **Timeout errors**: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps\n- **Poly Haven integration**: Claude is sometimes erratic with its behaviour\n- **Have you tried turning it off and on again?**: If you're still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and the Blender server\n\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\nThe system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets:\n\n- **Commands** are sent as JSON objects with a `type` and optional `params`\n- **Responses** are JSON objects with a `status` and `result` or `message`\n\n## Limitations & Security Considerations\n\n- The `execute_blender_code` tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. ALWAYS save your work before using it.\n- Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender. \n- Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Returns an vj:// URI to reference the Video file\n- create-videojungle-project\n  - Creates a Video Jungle project to contain generative scripts, analyzed videos, and images for video edit generation\n- edit-locally\n  - Creates an OpenTimelineIO project and downloads it to your machine to open in a Davinci Resolve Studio instance (Resolve Studio _must_ already be running before calling this tool.) \n- generate-edit-from-videos\n  - Generates a rendered video edit from a set of video files\n- generate-edit-from-single-video\n  - Generate an edit from a single input video file\n- get-project-assets\n  - Get assets within a project for video edit generation.\n- search-videos\n  - Returns video matches based upon embeddings and keywords\n- update-video-edit\n  - Live update a video edit's information. If Video Jungle is open, edit will be updated in real time.\n\n### Using Tools in Practice\n\nIn order to use the tools, you'll need to sign up for Video Jungle and add your API key.\n\n**add-video**\n\nHere's an example prompt to invoke the `add-video` tool:\n\n```\ncan you download the video at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RumgYaH5XYw and name it fly traps?\n```\n\nThis will download a video from a URL, add it to your library, and analyze it for retrieval later. Analysis is multi-modal, so both audio and visual components can be queried against.\n\n**search-videos**\n\nOnce you've got a video downloaded and analyzed, you can then do queries on it using the `search-videos` tool:\n\n```\ncan you search my videos for fly traps?\n```\n\nSearch results contain relevant metadata for generating a video edit according to details discovered in the initial analysis.\n\n**search-local-videos**\n\nYou must set the environment variable `LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1` in order to use this tool, as it will make Claude prompt to access your files on your local machine.\n\nOnce that's done, you can search through your Photos app for videos that exist on your phone, using Apple's tags.\n\nIn my case, when I search for \"Skateboard\", I get 1903 video files.\n\n```\ncan you search my local video files for Skateboard?\n```\n\n**generate-edit-from-videos**\n\nFinally, you can use these search results to generate an edit:\n\n```\ncan you create an edit of all the times the video says \"fly trap\"?\n```\n\n(Currently), the video edits tool relies on the context within the current chat. \n\n**generate-edit-from-single-video**\n\nFinally, you can cut down an edit from a single, existing video:\n\n```\ncan you create an edit of all the times this video says the word \"fly trap\"?\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou must login to [Video Jungle settings](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings), and get your [API key](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings). Then, use this to start Video Jungle MCP:\n\n```bash\n$ uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n\nTo allow this MCP server to search your Photos app on MacOS:\n\n```\n$ LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1 uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n## Quickstart\n\n### Install\n\n#### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Video Editor for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/video-editor-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install video-editor-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n\nYou'll need to adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` manually:\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n<details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Published Server Configuration</summary>\n  \n ```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n ```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  With local Photos app access enabled (search your Photos app):\n\n  ```json\n    \"video-jungle-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/Users/<PATH_TO>/video-jungle-mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"<YOURAPIKEY>\"\n      ],\n     \"env\": {\n\t      \"LOAD_PHOTOS_DB\": \"1\"\n      }\n    },\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\nBe sure to replace the directories with the directories you've placed the repository in on **your** computer.\n\n## Development\n\n### Building and Publishing\n\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n2. Build package distributions:\n```bash\nuv build\n```\n\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\n\n3. Publish to PyPI:\n```bash\nuv publish\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\n- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\n- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\n\n### MCP Server Registry\n\n```\nmcp-name: io.github.burningion/video-editing-mcp\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\n\n(Be sure to replace `YOURDIRECTORY` and `YOURAPIKEY` with the directory this repo is in, and your Video Jungle API key, found in the settings page.)\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --directory /Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\nAdditionally, I've added logging to `app.log` in the project directory. You can add logging to diagnose API calls via a:\n\n```\nlogging.info(\"this is a test log\")\n```\n\nA reasonable way to follow along as you're workin on the project is to open a terminal session and do a:\n\n```bash\n$ tail -n 90 -f app.log\n```\n",

Use the `NPX` method from that section.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n- [Available Tools](#available-tools)\n- [Caveats](#caveats)\n- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n- [Setup](#setup)\n- [Running the Server](#running-the-server-locally)\n  - [Option 1: Local Development](#option-1-local-development)\n  - [Option 2: Docker](#option-2-docker)\n- [Inspection](#inspection)\n- [MCP Clients](#mcp-clients)\n  - [Claude Desktop Configuration](#claude-desktop-configuration)\n    - [NPX](#npx)\n    - [Local Node](#local-node)\n    - [Docker](#docker)\n  - [LibreChat](#librechat)\n  - [LM Studio](#lm-studio)\n- [TODO](#todo)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis MCP server is built using [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp), a typescript framework for building MCP servers. For more information about MCP and how to use MCP servers, please refer to the [FastMCP documentation](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md) and the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\n## Available Tools\n\nCheck out the list of available tools: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)\n\n## Caveats\n\n- The [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers) is not perfect and some endpoints may not be fully documented or may have inconsistencies.\n- Due to the vast number of API endpoints and response types, it's not feasible to verify type safety for every possible response. Please report any type-related issues you encounter.\n- This MCP server allows for editing data in your Discogs collection. Please use with caution and verify your actions before executing them.\n- The Discogs API `per_page` default is `50`, which can be too much data for some clients to process effectively, so within this project a `discogs.config.defaultPerPage` value has been set to `5`. You can request more data in your prompts, but be aware that some clients may struggle with larger responses.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (tested with Node.js `20.x.x`, but `18.x.x` should work as well)\n  - Check your Node.js version with: `node --version`\n- Docker (optional, for running a local docker image without having to deal with Node or dependencies)\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`\n3. Set the following required environment variables in your `.env`:\n   - `DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Discogs personal access token\n\nTo get your Discogs personal access token, go to your [Discogs Settings > Developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) page and find your token or generate a new one. **_DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN_**. OAuth support will be added in a future release.\n\nThe other environment variables in `.env.example` are optional and have sensible defaults, so you don't need to set them unless you have specific requirements.\n\n## Running the Server Locally\n\n### Option 1: Local Development\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pnpm install\n   ```\n\n2. Available commands:\n   - `pnpm run dev`: Start the development server with hot reloading\n   - `pnpm run dev:stream`: Start the development server with hot reloading in HTTP streaming mode\n   - `pnpm run build`: Build the production version\n   - `pnpm run start`: Run the production build\n   - `pnpm run inspect`: Run the MCP Inspector (see [Inspection](#inspection) section)\n   - `pnpm run format`: Check code formatting (prettier)\n   - `pnpm run lint`: Run linter (eslint)\n   - `pnpm run test`: Run vitest\n   - `pnpm run test:coverage`: Run vitest v8 coverage\n   - `pnpm run version:check`: Checks that the package.json version and src/version.ts match\n\n### Option 2: Docker\n\n1. Build the Docker image:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t discogs-mcp-server:latest .\n   ```\n\n2. Run the container:\n   ```bash\n   docker run --env-file .env discogs-mcp-server:latest\n   ```\n\n   For HTTP Streaming transport mode:\n   ```bash\n   # The port should match what is in your .env file\n   docker run --env-file .env -p 3001:3001 discogs-mcp-server:latest stream\n   ```\n\n## Inspection\n\nRun the MCP Inspector to test your local MCP server:\n\n```bash\npnpm run inspect\n```\n\nThis will start the MCP Inspector at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`. Visit this URL in your browser to interact with your local MCP server.\n\nFor more information about the MCP Inspector, visit [the official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).\n\n## MCP Clients\n\nMore client examples will be added in the future. If you'd like configuration for a specific client, either\nrequest it by opening a new issue or creating the pull request to edit this section of the README yourself.\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nFind your `claude_desktop_config.json` at `Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config` and depending on which option you'd like, add **JUST ONE** of the following:\n\n#### NPX\n\nRunning it straight from the npm registry.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"discogs-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Local Node\n\nDependencies should have been installed before you use this method (`pnpm install`).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"tsx\",\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/src/index.ts\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Docker\n\nThe docker image should have been built before using this method.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--env-file\",\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/.env\",\n        \"discogs-mcp-server:latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny changes to local code will require Claude to be restarted to take effect. Also, Claude requires human-in-the-loop interaction to allow an MCP tool to be run, so everytime a new tool is accessed Claude will ask for permission. You usually only have to do this once per tool per chat. _If using the free version, long chats may result in more frequent errors trying to run tools as Claude limits the amount of context within a single chat._\n\n### LibreChat\n\nIn the `librechat.yaml` configuration file, add this under the `mcpServers` section:\n\n```yaml\ndiscogs:\n  type: stdio\n  command: npx\n  args: [\"-y\", \"discogs-mcp-server\"]\n  env:\n    DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\n```\n\n### LM Studio\n\nGet to the Chat `Settings`. In the `Program` tab there will be a dropdown with a default of `Install`. Select `Edit mcp.json`. Add this under the `mcpServers` section:\n\n```json\n\"discogs\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"discogs-mcp-server\"\n  ],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter you Save, in the `Program` tab there should now be an `mcp/discogs` toggle to enable the server. Within every chat box there is an `Integrations` menu where you can also enable mcp servers.\n\n## TODO\n\n- OAuth support\n- Missing tools:\n  - Inventory uploading\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License. This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the software, subject to the terms and conditions of the MIT License.

It allows AI clients to access movie, TV show, and person data through a standardized protocol.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Search Movies**: Perform multi-search across movies, TV shows, and people using the `search_tmdb` tool.\n- **Get Details**: Fetch detailed information for specific items using the `get_tmdb_details` tool.\n- **Trending Content**: Retrieve trending content across all media types with the `trending_all` tool.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js version 18 or higher (required for global fetch support)\n- A TMDB API key (Bearer token) from your admin, used with the TNL TMDB proxy (production-api.tnl.one)\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Set up your TMDB API key as an environment variable:\n\n   - On Windows PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     $env:TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN=\"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     export TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN=\"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n     ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the MCP Server\n\nTo start the server:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe server communicates over stdio and should be configured in your MCP-compatible client (e.g., IDE or chat client) with the command `node mcp-tmdb-server.js` and the `TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.\n\n### MCP Integration Examples\n\nHere are code snippets showing how to integrate with the MCP tools:\n\n#### Search for Movies\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for searching\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"search_tmdb\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"query\": \"dune\",\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"language\": \"en-US\",\n      \"include_adult\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get Movie Details\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for getting details\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_tmdb_details\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"type\": \"movie\",\n      \"id\": 438631,\n      \"append\": \"credits,images\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get Trending Content\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for trending content\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"trending_all\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"time_window\": \"day\",\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"language\": \"en-US\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP Client Integration\n\nPer integrare questo MCP server nel tuo client MCP (come un IDE o un client di chat compatibile), segui questi passi:\n\n1. Installa il pacchetto npm se necessario:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g wizzy-mcp-tmdb\n   ```\n\n2. Crea o aggiorna il file `mcp.json` nel tuo client MCP con la seguente configurazione:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"tmdb\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"wizzy-mcp-tmdb\"],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n         },\n         \"alwaysAllow\": [\n           \"get_watch_providers\",\n           \"discover_tv\",\n           \"discover_by_provider\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Nota: Il `TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN` può essere impostato a un valore casuale per ora, poiché le chiamate API TMDB sono gratuite e non richiedono autenticazione obbligatoria.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nThe project uses Jest for comprehensive testing, including:\n\n- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual handler functions, input validation, and response formatting (see `tests/unit/handlers.test.js`).\n- **Integration Tests**: Test API interactions with mocked responses, error handling, and network failures (see `tests/integration/api.test.js`).\n- **Protocol Tests**: Ensure MCP protocol compliance, including tool listing and calling (see `tests/protocol/mcp.test.js`).\n\nRun the test suite with:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nFor watch mode:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test:watch\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nwizzy-mcp-tmdb/\n├── mcp-tmdb-server.js          # Main MCP server implementation\n├── package.json                # Project configuration and dependencies\n├── MCP_GUIDE.md                # Detailed MCP integration guide\n├── babel.config.cjs            # Babel configuration for Jest\n├── tests/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   └── handlers.test.js    # Unit tests for handlers\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   └── api.test.js         # Integration tests for API calls\n│   └── protocol/\n│       └── mcp.test.js         # MCP protocol compliance tests\n└── tests/fixtures/             # Mock data for tests\n    ├── movieDetails.json\n    ├── searchMultiResponse.json\n    └── trendingAllResponse.json\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

Go to Cursor preferences, choose MCP and add a global MCP server:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"isaac-sim\": {\n            \"command\": \"uv run /home/ubuntu/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/isaac_mcp/server.py\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Development Mode\n\nTo develop the MCP Server, start the MCP inspector:\n\n```bash\nuv run mcp dev ~/Documents/isaac-sim-mcp/isaac_mcp/server.py\n```\n\nYou can visit the debug page through http://localhost:5173\n\n## Example Prompts for Simulation\nNotice: Switch to Agent mode in top left of Chat dialog before you type prompt and choose sonnet 3.7 for better coding.\n\n### Robot Party\n```\n# Create robots and improve lighting\ncreate  3x3 frankas robots in these current stage across location [3, 0, 0] and [6, 3, 0]\nalways check connection with get_scene_info before execute code.\nadd more light in the stage\n\n\n# Add specific robots at positions\ncreate a g1 robot at [3, 9, 0]\nadd Go1 robot at location [2, 1, 0]\nmove go1 robot to [1, 1, 0]\n```\n\n### Factory Setup\n```\n# Create multiple robots in a row\nacreate  3x3 frankas robots in these current stage across location [3, 0, 0] and [6, 3, 0]\nalways check connection with get_scene_info before execute code.\nadd more light in the stage\n\n\n```\n### Vibe Coding from scratch\n```\nreference to g1.py to create an new g1 robot simulation and allow robot g1 walk straight  from [0, 0, 0] to [3, 0, 0] and [3, 3, 0]\ncreate more obstacles in the stage\n\n```\n### Gen3D with beaver3d model support\n\n```\nUse following images to generate beaver 3d objects and place them into a grid area across [0, 0, 0] to [40, 40, 0] with scale [3, 3, 3]\n\n<your image url here, could be multiple images urls>\n```\n\n### USD search\n```\nsearch a rusty desk and place it at [0, 5, 0] with scale [3, 3, 3]\n```\n\n## MCP Tools\n\nThe Isaac Sim MCP Extension provides several specialized tools that can be accessed through natural language in Cursor AI. These tools enable you to control and manipulate NVIDIA Isaac Sim with simple commands:\n\n### Connection and Scene Management\n\n- **get_scene_info** - Pings the Isaac Sim Extension Server to verify connection status and retrieve basic scene information. Always use this first to ensure the connection is active.\n\n### Physics and Environment Creation\n\n- **create_physics_scene** - Creates a physics scene with configurable parameters:\n  - `objects`: List of objects to create (each with type and position)\n  - `floor`: Whether to create a ground plane (default: true)\n  - `gravity`: Vector defining gravity direction and magnitude (default: [0, -0.981, 0])\n  - `scene_name`: Name for the scene (default: \"physics_scene\")\n\n### Robot Creation and Control\n\n- **create_robot** - Creates a robot in the scene at a specified position:\n  - `robot_type`: Type of robot to create (options: \"franka\", \"jetbot\", \"carter\", \"g1\", \"go1\")\n  - `position`: [x, y, z] position coordinates\n\n### Omniverse Kit and Scripting\n\n- **omni_kit_command** - Executes an Omni Kit command:\n  - `command`: The Omni Kit command to execute (e.g., \"CreatePrim\")\n  - `prim_type`: The primitive type for the command (e.g., \"Sphere\")\n\n- **execute_script** - Executes arbitrary Python code in Isaac Sim:\n  - `code`: Python code to execute\n\n### Usage Best Practices\n\n1. Always check connection with `get_scene_info` before executing any commands\n2. Initialize a physics scene with `create_physics_scene` before adding robots\n3. Use `create_robot` for standard robot placement before trying custom scripts\n4. For complex simulations, use `execute_script` with proper async patterns\n5. Preview code in chat before execution for verification\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

This guide covers:\n- Prerequisites and system requirements\n- Step-by-step installation process\n- Configuration details\n- Common troubleshooting steps\n\n## Platform Support\n\n| Platform | Status | One-Step Install | Quick Start |\n|----------|--------|------------------|-------------|\n| macOS | ✅ Stable | `./install.sh` | `./run-now.sh` |\n| Windows | ✅ Stable | `install.bat` | `run-now.bat` |\n| Linux | ❌ Not supported | N/A | N/A |\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n### New One-Step Installation (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to get started is with our new unified installation script. This script does everything automatically:\n\n- Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp.git\n   cd davinci-resolve-mcp\n   ```\n\n- Make sure DaVinci Resolve Studio is installed and running\n\n- Run the installation script:\n   **macOS/Linux:**\n   ```bash\n   ./install.sh\n   ```\n   \n   **Windows:**\n   ```batch\n   install.bat\n   ```\n\nThis will:\n1. Automatically detect the correct paths on your system\n2. Create a Python virtual environment\n3. Install the MCP SDK from the official repository\n4. Set up environment variables\n5. Configure Cursor/Claude integration \n6. Verify the installation is correct\n7. Optionally start the MCP server\n\n### Alternative Quick Start\n\nYou can also use the original quick start scripts:\n\n**Windows Users:**\n```bash\nrun-now.bat\n``` \n\n**macOS Users:**\n```bash\nchmod +x run-now.sh\n./run-now.sh\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor configuration of DaVinci Resolve MCP with different AI assistant clients like Cursor or Claude, see the [config-templates](config-templates) directory.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting guidance, refer to the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#troubleshooting) file which contains solutions to common issues.\n\n### Common Issues\n\n#### Path Resolution\n- The installation scripts now use more robust path resolution, fixing issues with `run-now.sh` looking for files in the wrong locations\n- Always let the scripts determine the correct paths based on their location\n\n#### DaVinci Resolve Detection\n- We've improved the process detection to reliably find DaVinci Resolve regardless of how it appears in the process list\n- Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting the MCP server\n\n#### Environment Variables\n- Make sure all required environment variables are set correctly\n- Review the log file at `scripts/cursor_resolve_server.log` for troubleshooting\n\n### Windows\n- Make sure to use forward slashes (/) in configuration files\n- Python must be installed and paths configured in configs\n- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server\n\n### macOS\n- Make sure scripts have execute permissions\n- Check Console.app for any Python-related errors\n- Verify environment variables are set correctly\n- DaVinci Resolve must be running before starting the server\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues and feature requests, please use the GitHub issue tracker.\n\n## Launch Options\n\nAfter installation, you have several ways to start the server:\n\n### Client-Specific Launch Scripts\n\nThe repository includes dedicated scripts for launching with specific clients:\n\n```bash\n# For Cursor integration (macOS)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n\n# For Claude Desktop integration (macOS)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n```\n\nThese specialized scripts:\n- Set up the proper environment for each client\n- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running\n- Configure client-specific settings\n- Start the MCP server with appropriate parameters\n\n### Pre-Launch Check\n\nBefore connecting AI assistants, verify your environment is properly configured:\n\n```bash\n# On macOS\n./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh\n\n# On Windows\n./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat\n```\n\nThese scripts will:\n- Verify DaVinci Resolve is running (and offer to start it)\n- Check environment variables are properly set\n- Ensure the Python environment is configured correctly\n- Validate Cursor/Claude configuration\n- Optionally launch Cursor\n\n### Universal Launcher\n\nFor advanced users, our unified launcher provides full control over both Cursor and Claude Desktop servers:\n\n```bash\n# Make the script executable (macOS only)\nchmod +x scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh\n\n# Run in interactive mode\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh\n\n# Or use command line options\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor    # Start Cursor server (uses mcp_resolve-cursor_start)\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude    # Start Claude Desktop server (uses mcp_resolve-claude_start)\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-both      # Start both servers\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --stop-all        # Stop all running servers\n./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --status          # Show server status\n```\n\nAdditional options:\n- Force mode (skip Resolve running check): `--force`\n- Project selection: `--project \"Project Name\"`\n\n## Full Installation\n\nFor a complete manual installation:\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp.git\n   cd davinci-resolve-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. Create a Python virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   # Create virtual environment\n   python -m venv venv\n   \n   # Activate it\n   # On macOS/Linux:\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   # On Windows:\n   venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   \n   # Install dependencies from requirements.txt\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   \n   # Alternatively, install MCP SDK directly\n   pip install git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git\n   ```\n\n3. Set up DaVinci Resolve scripting environment variables:\n\n   **For macOS**:\n   ```bash\n   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API=\"/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Developer/Scripting\"\n   export RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB=\"/Applications/DaVinci Resolve/DaVinci Resolve.app/Contents/Libraries/Fusion/fusionscript.so\"\n   export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:$RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API/Modules/\"\n   ```\n\n   **For Windows**:\n   ```cmd\n   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API=C:\\ProgramData\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\Support\\Developer\\Scripting\n   set RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB=C:\\Program Files\\Blackmagic Design\\DaVinci Resolve\\fusionscript.dll\n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API%\\Modules\n   ```\n   \n   Alternatively, run the pre-launch check script which will set these for you:\n   ```\n   # On macOS\n   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.sh\n   \n   # On Windows\n   ./scripts/check-resolve-ready.bat\n   ```\n\n4. Configure Cursor to use the server by creating a configuration file:\n\n   **For macOS** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"/path/to/your/venv/bin/python\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **For Windows** (`%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\mcp.json`):\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\venv\\\\Scripts\\\\python.exe\",\n         \"args\": [\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\davinci-resolve-mcp\\\\src\\\\main.py\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Start the server using one of the client-specific scripts:\n   ```bash\n   # For Cursor\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n   \n   # For Claude Desktop\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n   ```\n\n## Usage with AI Assistants\n\n### Using with Cursor\n\n1. Start the Cursor server using the dedicated script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-cursor_start\n   ```\n   Or use the universal launcher:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-cursor\n   ```\n\n2. Start Cursor and open a project.\n\n3. In Cursor's AI chat, you can now interact with DaVinci Resolve. Try commands like:\n   - \"What version of DaVinci Resolve is running?\"\n   - \"List all projects in DaVinci Resolve\"\n   - \"Create a new timeline called 'My Sequence'\"\n   - \"Add a marker at the current position\"\n\n### Using with Claude Desktop\n\n1. Create a `claude_desktop_config.json` file in your Claude Desktop configuration directory using the template in the `config-templates` directory.\n\n2. Run the Claude Desktop server using the dedicated script:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve-claude_start\n   ```\n   Or use the universal launcher:\n   ```bash\n   ./scripts/mcp_resolve_launcher.sh --start-claude\n   ```\n\n3.

The code is structured with clear sections for different areas of functionality.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- Blackmagic Design for DaVinci Resolve and its API\n- The MCP protocol team for enabling AI assistant integration\n\n## Project Structure\n\nAfter cleanup, the project has the following structure:\n\n- `resolve_mcp_server.py` - The main MCP server implementation\n- `run-now.sh` - Quick start script that handles setup and runs the server\n- `setup.sh` - Complete setup script for installation\n- `check-resolve-ready.sh` - Pre-launch check to verify DaVinci Resolve is ready\n- `start-server.sh` - Script to start the server\n- `run-server.sh` - Simplified script to run the server directly\n\n**Key Directories:**\n- `src/` - Source code and modules\n- `assets/` - Project assets and resources\n- `logs/` - Log files directory\n- `scripts/` - Helper scripts\n\nWhen developing, it's recommended to use `./run-now.sh` which sets up the environment and launches the server in one step. \n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes. \n\n### Cursor-Specific Setup\n\nWhen integrating with Cursor, follow these specific steps:\n\n1. Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n\n2. Install required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   # From the davinci-resolve-mcp directory:\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   Note: This will install the MCP package and other dependencies automatically.\n\n3. Set up the MCP server configuration in Cursor:\n   \n   Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` on macOS (or `%USERPROFILE%\\.cursor\\mcp.json` on Windows):\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"/path/to/your/venv/bin/python\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   **Important Notes:**\n   - Use `main.py` as the entry point (not `resolve_mcp_server.py`)\n   - Use absolute paths in the configuration\n\n4. Common issues:\n   - \"Client closed\" error: Check that paths are correct in mcp.json and dependencies are installed\n   - Connection problems: Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n   - Environment variables: The main.py script will handle setting environment variables",
