      "readme_content": "# WireMCP\nWireMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with real-time network traffic analysis capabilities. By leveraging tools built on top of Wireshark's `tshark`, WireMCP captures and processes live network data, providing LLMs with structured context to assist in tasks like threat hunting, network diagnostics, and anomaly detection.\n\n# Features\nWireMCP exposes the following tools to MCP clients, enhancing LLM understanding of network activity:\n\n- **`capture_packets`**: Captures live traffic and returns raw packet data as JSON, enabling LLMs to analyze packet-level details (e.g., IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods).\n- **`get_summary_stats`**: Provides protocol hierarchy statistics, giving LLMs an overview of traffic composition (e.g., TCP vs. UDP usage).\n- **`get_conversations`**: Delivers TCP/UDP conversation statistics, allowing LLMs to track communication flows between endpoints.\n- **`check_threats`**: Captures IPs and checks them against the URLhaus blacklist, equipping LLMs with threat intelligence context for identifying malicious activity.\n- **`check_ip_threats`**: Performs targeted threat intelligence lookups for specific IP addresses against multiple threat feeds, providing detailed reputation and threat data.\n- **`analyze_pcap`**: Analyzes PCAP files to provide comprehensive packet data in JSON format, enabling detailed post-capture analysis of network traffic.\n- **`extract_credentials`**: Scans PCAP files for potential credentials from various protocols (HTTP Basic Auth, FTP, Telnet), aiding in security audits and forensic analysis.\n\n\n## How It Helps LLMs\nWireMCP bridges the gap between raw network data and LLM comprehension by:\n- **Contextualizing Traffic**: Converts live packet captures into structured outputs (JSON, stats) that LLMs can parse and reason about.\n- **Threat Detection**: Integrates IOCs (currently URLhaus) to flag suspicious IPs, enhancing LLM-driven security analysis.\n- **Diagnostics**: Offers detailed traffic insights, enabling LLMs to assist with troubleshooting or identifying anomalies.\n- **Narrative Generation**: LLM's can Transform complex packet captures into coherent stories, making network analysis accessible to non-technical users.\n\n# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Mac / Windows / Linux\n- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (with `tshark` installed and accessible in PATH)\n- Node.js (v16+ recommended)\n- npm (for dependency installation)\n\n## Setup\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/0xkoda/WireMCP.git\n   cd WireMCP\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Run the MCP server:\n   ```bash\n   node index.js\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Ensure `tshark` is in your PATH. WireMCP will auto-detect it or fall back to common install locations (e.g., `/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/tshark` on macOS).\n\n# Usage with MCP Clients\n\nWireMCP works with any MCP-compliant client. Below are examples for popular clients:\n\n## Example 1: Cursor\n\nEdit `mcp.json` in Cursor -> Settings -> MCP :\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"wiremcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/WireMCP/index.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Location (macOS)**: `/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n## Other Clients\n\nThis MCP will work well with any client. Use the command `node /path/to/WireMCP/index.js` in their MCP server settings.\n\n# Example Output\n\nRunning `check_threats` might yield:\n\n```\nCaptured IPs:\n174.67.0.227\n52.196.136.253\n\nThreat check against URLhaus blacklist:\nNo threats detected in URLhaus blacklist.\n```\n\nRunning `analyze_pcap` on a capture file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [{\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"text\": \"Analyzed PCAP: ./capture.pcap\\n\\nUnique IPs:\\n192.168.0.2\\n192.168.0.1\\n\\nProtocols:\\neth:ethertype:ip:tcp\\neth:ethertype:ip:tcp:telnet\\n\\nPacket Data:\\n[{\\\"layers\\\":{\\\"frame.number\\\":[\\\"1\\\"],\\\"ip.src\\\":[\\\"192.168.0.2\\\"],\\\"ip.dst\\\":[\\\"192.168.0.1\\\"],\\\"tcp.srcport\\\":[\\\"1550\\\"],\\\"tcp.dstport\\\":[\\\"23\\\"]}}]\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n\nLLMs can use these outputs to:\n- Provide natural language explanations of network activity\n- Identify patterns and potential security concerns\n- Offer context-aware recommendations\n- Generate human-readable reports\n\n# Roadmap\n\n- **Expand IOC Providers**: Currently uses URLhaus for threat checks. Future updates will integrate additional sources (e.g., IPsum, Emerging Threats) for broader coverage.\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n- Wireshark/tshark team for their excellent packet analysis tools\n- Model Context Protocol community for the framework and specifications\n- URLhaus for providing threat intelligence data",

Clone this repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/Cyreslab-AI/hibp-mcp-server.git\n   cd hibp-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Build the server:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n4. Configure the server in your MCP settings file:\n\n   For Claude VSCode extension, add to `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"hibp\": {\n         \"command\": \"node\",\n         \"args\": [\"/path/to/hibp-mcp-server/build/index.js\"],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"HIBP_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\n         },\n         \"disabled\": false,\n         \"autoApprove\": []\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   For Claude desktop app, add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or similar path on other platforms.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nOnce the server is configured, you can use it with Claude to check for data breaches:\n\n### Check Email\n\n```\nUser: Has my email address example@gmail.com been pwned?\n\nClaude: Good news! This email address has not been found in any known data breaches.\n```\n\nOr if the email was found in breaches:\n\n```\nUser: Has my email address breached@example.com been pwned?\n\nClaude: ⚠️ This email address was found in 3 data breaches.\n\nBreach details:\n\n1. Adobe (2013-10-04)\n   Domain: adobe.com\n   Description: In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached...\n   Compromised data: Email addresses, Password hints, Passwords, Usernames\n\n2. LinkedIn (2012-05-05)\n   Domain: linkedin.com\n   Description: In May 2016, LinkedIn had 164 million email addresses and passwords exposed...\n   Compromised data: Email addresses, Passwords\n\n3. Dropbox (2012-07-01)\n   Domain: dropbox.com\n   Description: In mid-2012, Dropbox suffered a data breach which exposed...\n   Compromised data: Email addresses, Passwords\n\nRecommendations:\n- Change your password for these services immediately\n- If you used the same password elsewhere, change those too\n- Enable two-factor authentication where available\n- Consider using a password manager\n```\n\n### Check Password\n\n```\nUser: Has the password \"password123\" been exposed in any breaches?\n\nClaude: ⚠️ This password has been exposed in data breaches 123,456 times!\n\nRecommendations:\n- Stop using this password immediately\n- Change it on any site where you use it\n- Use a unique, strong password for each account\n- Consider using a password manager\n```\n\n### Get Breach Details\n\n```\nUser: Tell me about the LinkedIn data breach\n\nClaude: # LinkedIn Data Breach\n\n**Date:** 2012-05-05\n**Domain:** linkedin.com\n**Accounts affected:** 164,611,595\n**Verified:** Yes\n**Data leaked:** Email addresses, Passwords\n\n**Description:**\nIn May 2016, LinkedIn had 164 million email addresses and passwords exposed. Originally hacked in 2012, the data remained out of sight until being offered for sale on a dark market site 4 years later. The passwords in the breach were stored as SHA1 hashes without salt, the vast majority of which were quickly cracked in the days following the release of the data.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- If you had an account on this service, change your password\n- If you used the same password elsewhere, change those too\n- Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity\n- Be cautious of phishing attempts that may use this leaked information\n```\n\n### List All Breaches\n\n```\nUser: List all Adobe data breaches\n\nClaude: Found 1 breaches for domain adobe.com:\n\n1. Adobe (2013-10-04)\n   Domain: adobe.com\n   Accounts affected: 152,445,165\n   Compromised data: Email addresses, Password hints, Passwords, Usernames\n```\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- The password checking feature uses k-anonymity to check passwords without sending the full password to the Have I Been Pwned API\n- Only the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password are sent to the API\n- The API returns a list of hash suffixes that match the prefix, and the check is completed locally\n\n## API Key Configuration\n\nThis server requires a Have I Been Pwned API key to function for most features (except password checking). You can get an API key at [haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key).\n\nThe API key should be provided as an environment variable named `HIBP_API_KEY` in your MCP settings configuration.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

      "readme_content": "# Super Windows CLI MCP Server\n\nAn enhanced fork of the Windows CLI MCP Server providing unrestricted system access to Windows environments via a command-line interface (MCP).\n\n**Based on:** [win-cli-mcp-server](https://github.com/SimonB97/win-cli-mcp-server) by SimonB97.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING ⚠️\n\nThis server is designed to run with **SYSTEM-level privileges** on Windows. This grants it **complete and unrestricted access** to the entire operating system, including all files, processes, and configuration settings.\n\n*   **DO NOT** install or run this server unless you fully understand the implications of granting SYSTEM-level access.\n*   **ONLY** use this server in **highly trusted environments** where you have full control over network access.\n*   **NETWORK SECURITY IS PARAMOUNT:** Since application-level restrictions are minimal by design, rely heavily on firewalls, network segmentation, and strict access control lists (ACLs) to protect the machine running this server.\n*   **REVIEW THE CONFIGURATION CAREFULLY:** Pay close attention to `allowedPaths`, `blockedCommands`, and other security settings in `config.json`. A misconfiguration can easily expose your system.\n\n**Use this software responsibly and at your own risk. The maintainers assume no liability for misuse or security breaches resulting from its use.**\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n*   Complete access to Windows shell environments (PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash - configurable).\n*   Unrestricted command execution (configurable via `config.json`).\n*   Full file system access (configurable via `config.json`).\n*   SYSTEM-level service installation via NSSM for persistence and auto-recovery.\n*   Automatic service recovery features provided by NSSM.\n*   Network binding controls (intended, but primarily managed at the network/firewall level).\n*   Disabled PowerShell telemetry for enhanced privacy.\n*   Process reuse for performance (for shells).\n*   Extended timeouts for long-running operations (configurable).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:\n\n1.  **Node.js:** Version 18.0.0 or later. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). (Includes npm).\n2.  **NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager):** Required for reliable service installation. Download the latest version from [nssm.cc](https://nssm.cc/download).\n\n## Installation (Using NSSM - Recommended)\n\nThis method installs the server as a persistent Windows service that runs with SYSTEM privileges and starts automatically.\n\n1.  **Clone or Download:**\n    *   Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`\n    *   Or download the source code `.zip` and extract it to a suitable location (e.g., `C:\\Servers\\SuperWinCLIServer`). Avoid user profile folders.\n\n2.  **Place NSSM:**\n    *   Download NSSM from [nssm.cc](https://nssm.cc/download).\n    *   Extract the zip file.\n    *   Copy the `nssm.exe` file from the appropriate architecture folder (`win32` or `win64`) into the **root directory** of this project (the same folder as `install-service.ps1`).\n\n3.  **Install Dependencies & Build:**\n    *   Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) in the project's root directory.\n    *   Run: `npm install`\n    *   This command installs necessary Node.js packages and automatically runs `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code into the `dist` folder.\n\n4.  **Configure `config.json`:**\n    *   **Copy:** Make a copy of `config.sample.json` and name it `config.json` in the project's root directory.\n    *   **Edit:** Open `config.json` and **carefully review and modify** the settings:\n        *   `security.allowedPaths`: **CRITICAL!** Change this from the sample paths to the *actual* directories the server needs access to. For security, be as specific as possible. Start with the project directory itself if unsure (e.g., `\"C:\\\\Servers\\\\SuperWinCLIServer\"` - remember double backslashes `\\\\`). The service runs as SYSTEM, so paths must be valid for that account.\n        *   `security.blockedCommands` / `blockedArguments`: Review the default lists. Add or remove commands/arguments based on your security policy.\n        *   `shells`: Enable/disable shells (PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash) and verify the `command` path (especially for Git Bash).\n        *   `ssh`: Configure if you intend to use the SSH execution feature (disabled by default).\n    *   **Save** the `config.json` file.\n\n5.  **Run Installation Script:**\n    *   Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.\n    *   Navigate to the project's root directory (`cd C:\\Servers\\SuperWinCLIServer`).\n    *   Execute the installation script: `.\\install-service.ps1`\n    *   This script uses NSSM to install and configure the `MCPServer` service to run `node.exe dist/index.js` as `LocalSystem`, starting automatically.\n\n6.  **Verify Service Status:**\n    *   In the same administrative PowerShell window, run: `Get-Service MCPServer`\n    *   The status should be `Running`. If it's `Stopped`, check the NSSM logs or Windows Event Viewer (Application and System logs) for errors.\n\n## Configuration (`config.json`) Details\n\n*   **`security`**:\n    *   `maxCommandLength`: Max characters allowed in a command string.\n    *   `blockedCommands`: Array of command names (without extension) to block (case-insensitive).\n    *   `blockedArguments`: Array of exact arguments to block (case-insensitive).\n    *   `allowedPaths`: **Crucial setting.** Array of absolute paths. If `restrictWorkingDirectory` is true, commands can only be executed if their working directory starts with one of these paths. Paths are compared case-insensitively after normalization. Use double backslashes (e.g., `\"C:\\\\Tools\\\\Scripts\"`).\n    *   `restrictWorkingDirectory`: Boolean. If true, enforce the `allowedPaths` check for the working directory. Highly recommended to keep `true`.\n    *   `logCommands`: Boolean. If true, executed commands and their output (truncated) are stored in memory (up to `maxHistorySize`).\n    *   `maxHistorySize`: Max number of commands to keep in the in-memory history.\n    *   `commandTimeout`: Seconds before a running command is killed automatically.\n    *   `enableInjectionProtection`: Boolean. If true, attempts to block shell operators (`&`, `|`, `;`, etc. defined per shell) in commands.\n*   **`shells`**: Configure available local shells (powershell, cmd, gitbash).\n    *   `enabled`: Boolean. Allow use of this shell.\n    *   `command`: Path to the shell executable.\n    *   `args`: Array of default arguments passed to the shell before the user's command.\n    *   `blockedOperators`: Array of strings/characters to block within commands for this specific shell (used if `enableInjectionProtection` is true).\n*   **`ssh`**: Configure remote command execution via SSH.\n    *   `enabled`: Boolean. Enable the `ssh_execute` and `ssh_disconnect` tools.\n    *   `connections`: Object containing named connection configurations (host, port, username, password/privateKeyPath).\n*   **Configuration Merging:** When `config.json` is loaded, if it contains a `security` or `shells` section, that entire section **replaces** the default configuration for that section. It does *not* merge individual fields within `security` or `shells`. The `ssh` section is merged more granularly. Ensure your `config.json` includes all necessary fields for these sections if you customize them.\n\n## Service Management (NSSM)\n\nOnce installed via `install-service.ps1`, you can manage the service using standard Windows tools or NSSM commands from an **administrative PowerShell/CMD** in the project directory:\n\n*   **Start:** `Start-Service MCPServer` or `.\\nssm.exe start MCPServer`\n*   **Stop:** `Stop-Service MCPServer` or `.\\nssm.exe stop MCPServer`\n*   **Restart:** `Restart-Service MCPServer` or `.\\nssm.exe restart MCPServer`\n*   **Status:** `Get-Service MCPServer` or `.\\nssm.exe status MCPServer`\n*   **Edit Configuration (Advanced):** `.\\nssm.exe edit MCPServer` (Opens the NSSM GUI editor)\n*   **View Configuration:** `.\\nssm.exe dump MCPServer`\n\n## Uninstallation (NSSM)\n\n1.  Open **PowerShell as Administrator**.\n2.  Navigate to the project's root directory.\n3.  Execute the uninstallation script: `.\\uninstall-service.ps1`\n4.  This uses NSSM to stop and remove the `MCPServer` service.\n\n## Alternative Execution (Manual/Debug)\n\nYou can run the server directly without installing it as a service for testing or debugging purposes:\n\n1.  Ensure you have run `npm install`.\n2.  Ensure `config.json` exists and is configured.\n3.  Open a normal terminal (PowerShell/CMD) in the project root.\n4.  Run: `npm run start`\n5.  The server will run in the foreground. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n",

Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n\n### Why MCP?\nMCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:\n- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into\n- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors\n- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure\n\n### How it Works\nAt its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:\n\n\n\n- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Applications, Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP\n- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers\n- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol\n- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access\n- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to\n\n## Overview\nThis server provides a bridge between MCP clients and the privateGPT API, allowing you to:\n- Chat with privateGPT using both public and private knowledge bases\n- Create and manage knowledge sources\n- Organize sources into groups\n- Control access through group-based permissions\n\n\n---\n\n# Why Agents\nAn **agent** in relation to **LLMs** (Large Language Models) and **MCP servers** is a specialized software component that acts as an intermediary between language models and applications. It handles tasks such as processing requests, interacting with the LLM via MCP, managing workflows, ensuring security and efficiency within the overall system, and much more. By utilizing agents, complex AI-based applications can be designed to be effective, secure, and scalable.\n**The code for agents in this repository can be used to implement it into own solutions / applications.**\n\n## Interaction Between Agents, LLMs, and MCP Servers\nThe interaction of these components enables the development of powerful, scalable, and secure AI applications. Below is a simplified scenario that illustrates this interaction:\n\n1. **User Input:** A user sends a request through a user interface hosted on the MCP server.\n2. **Agent Processing:** An agent on the MCP server receives the request, validates it, and prepares it for the LLM.\n3. **LLM Interaction:** The agent forwards the request to the LLM, which generates a response.\n4. **Response Processing:** The agent receives the response from the LLM, processes it further if necessary (e.g., formatting, integration with other data sources), and sends it back to the user.\n5. **Security and Logging:** During this process, the agent monitors interactions, ensures that security policies are adhered to, and logs relevant information for later analysis.\n\n## Advantages of Using Agents in This Context\n- **Modularity:** Agents allow for a clear separation of responsibilities, making the system easier to maintain and scale.\n- **Security:** Centralized management of access and monitoring of activities help minimize security risks.\n- **Efficiency:** Automated agents can perform tasks faster and more consistently than manual processes.\n- **Flexibility:** Agents can be easily adapted or extended to support new functions or changes in business requirements.\n\n### Importance of Encrypting Passwords\nIn any application handling sensitive data, security is paramount. This server manages two critical sets of credentials:\n1. **Proxy Headers:** Used by for example HAProxy to authenticate and manage traffic.\n2. **LLM Access Passwords:** Used to secure access to the large language models.\n\nStoring these passwords in plaintext poses significant security risks, including unauthorized access and potential data breaches. \nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential to encrypt these passwords and handle only their ciphertext within the system.\n\n### Benefits of Using Ciphertext Only\n- **Enhanced Security:** Even if an attacker gains access to the configuration files or environment variables, encrypted passwords remain unintelligible without the corresponding decryption keys.\n- **Compliance:** Encryption helps in adhering to security standards and regulations that mandate the protection of sensitive information.\n- **Integrity:** Ensures that passwords cannot be tampered with, maintaining the integrity of the authentication mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n# Security\nThe following security features are implemented to ensure data protection and secure communication between the client application and server. These features cover encryption, decryption, key management, and transport security.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n- To secure communication between the client and server, TLS can be activate. All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using TLS (minimum version 1.2).\n\n## Why Should TLS Be Enabled Between Client and Server?\n\n### a. **Encryption of Communication**\n- TLS (Transport Layer Security) ensures that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted. This protects sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data from eavesdropping attacks (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).\n\n### b. **Data Integrity**\n- TLS guarantees that the transmitted data remains unchanged and unaltered. The integrity check ensures that the received data is exactly as it was sent.\n\n### c. **Authentication**\n- TLS enables secure authentication of the server (and optionally the client) through digital certificates. This prevents users from falling victim to phishing attacks on fake websites.\n\n### d. **Protection Against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**\n- TLS encrypts the connection, making it nearly impossible for attackers to intercept or manipulate traffic. Without TLS, attackers could capture and modify data packets.\n\n### e. **Compliance with Security Standards and Regulations**\n- Many regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) mandate secure data transmission. TLS is a fundamental component of these security requirements.\n\n### f. **Prevention of Downgrade and Replay Attacks**\n- TLS protects against attacks that attempt to downgrade a connection to an insecure version (downgrade attacks) or replay previously valid requests (replay attacks).\n\n## Conclusion\nEnabling TLS between client and server is essential to ensure data privacy, security, and communication integrity. It not only protects sensitive information but also helps meet compliance requirements and increases user trust.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Password Encryption\nPasswords can be encrypted using RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) public-key cryptography. This ensures that sensitive data, such as user passwords, are never transmitted in plaintext.\n\n### Method\n- **Public key encryption** with a **2048-bit key length**.\n- **Padding**: `RSA_PKCS1_PADDING` to enhance security and prevent known padding attacks.\n\n### Process\n1. The server administrator encrypts the client's password using the server's public key (`id_rsa_public.pem`) by executing `node security/generate_encrypted_password.js ~/.ssh/id_rsa_public.pem` and hand out the encrpyted password to the client.\n2. Alternatively: The client encrypts the password using the server's public key (`id_rsa_public.pem`) by using the `keygen` - Function. Therefore the function has to be enabled in the server's config (`privateGPT.env.json`). Important: Using this function also means transmitting data via the network. Therefore, make sure that the data traffic is secure and cannot be intercepted.\n3. Finally, the encrypted password is sent to the server, where it is decrypted using the server's private key.\n\n### Advantages\n- **Asymmetric encryption** ensures that only the server can decrypt the password.\n- Even if the communication channel is compromised, encrypted data remains secure.\n\n## 3. Key Management\nTo secure data communication and encryption processes, the following key management principles are followed:\n\n### Public Key\n- Stored securely on the server (`id_rsa.pub`).\n- Used only for encryption and does not pose a security risk if exposed.\n\n### PEM Key\n- Stored securely on the server (`id_rsa_public.pem`).\n- Has to be created by using the public cert (see: [Server Configuration](#server-configuration))\n\n### Private Key\n- Stored securely on the server (`id_rsa`).\n- Restricted access with appropriate file permissions (`chmod 600`).\n- Used exclusively for decryption operations.\n\n### Key Rotation\n- Keys can be rotated periodically or upon detection of a security incident. Important: if these are reissued, the clients or AI agents immediately lose access to the MCP server and require a new RSA key (encrypted password)!\n- Old keys are securely invalidated.\n\n## 4. Decryption on the Server\nDecryption is exclusively performed on the server using the private key:\n\n### Process\n1. The server receives the encrypted password from the client.\n2. The private key decrypts the password to retrieve the original plaintext.\n3. The decrypted password is used internally (e.g., authentication) and never stored in plaintext.\n\n### Secure Handling\n- Decrypted passwords exist in memory only for the duration of processing.\n- Secure memory management practices ensure sensitive data is cleared immediately after use.\n\n### Certificate Validation\n- Certificates are validated on both sides to ensure the authenticity of the server and client.\n- Optionally, mutual TLS can be enabled for enhanced security.\n\n## 5. Authorization Tokens\nTokens are used to authenticate requests and ensure only authorized users can access the system:\n\n### Token Management\n- Tokens are generated upon successful login.\n- They are short-lived and automatically expire after a predefined time.\n- Tokens are signed using HMAC or RSA, making them tamper-proof.\n\n## 6. Restriction of Key Generation (Keygen)\nTo prevent misuse of the system, key generation (`keygen`) is restricted:\n\n### Configuration\n- The server has a configuration option (`ALLOW_KEYGEN`) to enable or disable key generation.\n- Attempts to call the keygen function when disabled result in an error message.\n\n### Audit Logging\n- All keygen operations are logged for auditing and monitoring purposes.\n\n## 7. Certificate-Based Access Control (CBAC)\n- As the agent does not require a password when certificate authentication is activated and logs on to the server using a key, it is automatically locked to this server. \nIf it would want to log in to another MCP privateGPT server, this login attempt is rejected as the key is checked against the server's private certificate. \n\n### Features\n- Functions such as `keygen`, `store_user`, and `edit_source` are only accessible to authorized roles.\n- Unauthorized access attempts are denied with detailed error messages.\n\n### Configuration\n- Enabled or disabled functions can be specified in the server's configuration (`Functions` object).\n\n## 8. Secure Configuration\nThe server configuration contains several security-related options:\n\n### SSL_VALIDATE\n- Validates SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure communication.\n- Can be enabled or disabled based on environment requirements (e.g., testing vs. production).\n\n### PW_ENCRYPTION\n- Enables or disables password encryption.\n- Ensures compatibility in environments where encryption is not feasible.\n\n## 9. Logging and Monitoring\nAll security-related events are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting:\n\n### Logged Events\n- Failed login attempts.\n- Key generation requests.\n- Unauthorized access attempts.\n- Encryption and decryption errors.\n\n\n## Summary\nThe implemented security features ensure:\n\n- **Confidentiality** of sensitive data through encryption and secure transport.\n- **Integrity** of operations using robust key management and token validation.\n- **Role-based and configurable access control** for system functions.\n- **Comprehensive monitoring** for proactive detection and response to security threats.\n\nThese measures collectively provide a secure environment for client-server communication and data handling.\n\n\n# Feature Overview for privateGPT Server\nThe privateGPT Server offers a robust set of features designed to provide efficient, flexible, and secure communication with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Only request contaning `1234567890ABCDEFHIJ` in the header will be accepted:\n\n```bash\nbackend mcpserver.mydomain.com\n    acl valid_header req.hdr(X-Custom-Header) -m str \"1234567890ABCDEFHIJ\"\n    http-request deny unless valid_header\n    http-request del-header X-Custom-Header\n    server stable 172.16.123.4:443 ssl verify none\n```\n\n---\n\n### `Header Encryption`\n| Key                    | Description                                              | Example Value |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **HEADER_ENCRYPTED**   |Indicates if the custom proxy access header is encrypted. | `true`        |\n\n  - `\"true\"`: The access header is encrypted. Use the encryption tool in the security folder on the server to encrypt the Header.\n  - `\"false\"`: The access header is plain text.\n  \n---\n\n### `Access Header`\nThe custom header value used for proxy authentication or access control. If `HEADER_ENCRYPTED` is `\"true\"`, this value must be decrypted before use.\n\n\n| Key                | Description                                          | Example Value |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **ACCESS_HEADER**  | Used for proxy authentication or access control.     | `123abc..`    |\n\n\n## Notes\n- Ensure that `ACCESS_HEADER` is properly secured if `HEADER_ENCRYPTED` is set to `\"true\"`.\n- Double-check proxy server settings to avoid connectivity issues.\n\n---\n\n### Server Configuration\nFor secure certificate authentification, create a `.env` file with your privateGPT credentials, for example privateGPT.env.json \nSettings can be adjusted in the `.env` file to customize the server and its functionalities.\n\nGenerate the certificates (if you haven't ssh certificates use `ssh-keygen -t rsa`), .pem files are needed:\n```bash\nssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -e -m PEM > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_public.pem\n```\n\nAfter this process, you can create Ciphertext from passwords by using the Encrypted Password Encryption Tool and test the cipher with the Encrypted Password Decryption Tool.\nYou will find the descriptionof how it works in the `Security` section of this document.\n\nNext, you should provide the SSL/TLS certificates `server.crt` and `server.key` to ensure that communication with clients and agents is encrypted.\nIf you want to use self-signed certificates, you can generate them by executing f.e. the following command:\n```bash\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj \"/CN=localhost\"\n```\n\nNote: Clients and agents can detect that the server uses self-signed certificates, as these are potentially insecure compared to official certificates where the organisation is checked and more. However, clients and agents can accept communication with these certificates with the appropriate parameter (see description of the respective client and agent parameters).\n\n---\n\nBelow is a sample `.env` configuration file for the privateGPT server, including descriptions for each setting. \nCustomize these values to fit your environment and requirements.\n\n---\n\n## `Server Port`\n| Key      | Description                                    | Example Value |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **PORT** | The port on which the MCP server runs.         | `5000`        |\n\n---\n\n## `Language`\nThe system supports out-of-the-box: `de`, `en`, `pt`, `es`, `nl`, `fr`.\nEvery Language can be easily added by modifying the `privateGPT-messages.js`.

This tool ensures that sensitive password data remains protected during transmission and storage by leveraging robust encryption mechanisms. It is an essential component for systems requiring secure password handling and transmission between clients and servers.\n\n## Features\n- **Secure Encryption:** Utilizes RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) public-key cryptography to encrypt sensitive passwords.\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts users to input their passwords securely via the command line.\n- **Error Handling:** Provides comprehensive error messages for missing keys or encryption issues.\n- **Flexible Integration:** Can be integrated into larger systems requiring secure password handling and encryption.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Public Key Loading:** The script loads the RSA public key from a specified file path provided as a command-line argument.\n2. **Password Input:** It prompts the user to enter their password securely via the command line.\n3. **Encryption Process:** Using the loaded public key and `RSA_PKCS1_PADDING`, the script encrypts the entered password.\n4. **Output:** The encrypted password is displayed in Base64 format, ready for secure transmission or storage.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **RSA Public Key:** You must have access to the RSA public key (`id_rsa_public.pem`) used for encrypting the password.\n\n## Installation\n-  **Install Dependencies:**\n    The script uses built-in Node.js modules, so no additional dependencies are required. However, ensure that your Node.js version supports ES6 modules.\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json\n    npm cache clean --force\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n1. **Prepare Your RSA Public Key:**\n    Ensure you have your RSA public key (`id_rsa_public.pem`) stored securely on your MCP server.\n\n2. **Run the Script, you will find it at the `security` directory of the MCP server:**\n    Execute the script using Node.js, providing the path to your public key as a command-line argument.\n    ```bash\n    node encrypt_password.js /path/to/your/id_rsa_public.pem\n    ```\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```bash\n    node security/encrypt_password.js ~/.ssh/id_rsa_public.pem\n    ```\n\n3. **Enter Your Password:**\n    When prompted, input your password securely.\n    ```bash\n    Please enter your password: ********\n    ```\n\n4. **View the Encrypted Password:**\n    The script will output the encrypted password in Base64 format.\n    ```bash\n    Encrypted Password: <Your_Encrypted_Password>\n    ```\n\n---\n\n# Encrypted Password Decryption Tool\n\n## Overview\nThe **Encrypted Password Decryption Tool** is a Node.js script designed to securely decrypt encrypted passwords using RSA private-key cryptography. \nThis tool ensures that sensitive password data remains protected during transmission and storage by leveraging robust encryption and decryption mechanisms.\nTo verify or decrypt an encrypted password, use the private key. This is helpful to ensure that the encryption was performed correctly.\n\n## Features\n- **Secure Decryption:** Utilizes RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) private-key cryptography to decrypt sensitive password data.\n- **Error Handling:** Provides comprehensive error messages for missing keys or decryption issues.\n- **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts users to input encrypted passwords securely via the command line.\n- **Flexible Integration:** Can be integrated into larger systems requiring secure password handling.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Private Key Loading:** The script loads the RSA private key from a specified file path provided as a command-line argument.\n2. **Encrypted Password Input:** It prompts the user to enter an encrypted password in Base64 format.\n3. **Decryption Process:** Using the loaded private key and RSA_PKCS1_PADDING, the script decrypts the encrypted password.\n4. **Output:** The decrypted plaintext password is displayed in the console.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **RSA Private Key:** You must have access to the RSA private key (`id_rsa`) on your MCP server used for decrypting the password.\n\n## Installation\n- **Install Dependencies:**\n    The script uses built-in Node.js modules, so no additional dependencies are required. However, ensure that your Node.js version supports ES6 modules.\n\n## Usage\n1. **Prepare Your RSA Private Key:**\n    Ensure you have your RSA private key (`id_rsa`) stored securely on your machine.\n\n2. **Run the Script, you will find it at the `security` directory of the MCP server:**:**\n    Execute the script using Node.js, providing the path to your private key as a command-line argument.\n    ```bash\n    node decrypt_password.js /path/to/your/id_rsa\n    ```\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```bash\n    node decrypt_password.js ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n    ```\n\n3. **Enter the Encrypted Password:**\n    When prompted, input the encrypted password in Base64 format.\n    ```bash\n    Please enter the encrypted password: <Your_Encrypted_Password>\n    ```\n\n4. **View the Decrypted Password:**\n    The script will output the decrypted plaintext password.\n    ```bash\n    Decrypted Password: your_plaintext_password\n    ```\nThis will decrypt the encrypted password and display the original value.\n\n\n### Notes\n- Ensure that the `~/.ssh/id_rsa_public.pem` (public key) and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (private key) files exist and have the correct permissions.\n- The encryption tool relies on the public key, while the decryption tool requires the private key.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### MCP Server for MAS Developments – Complete Project Overview\nThis repository contains the

Experience memory forensics without barriers as plugins like `pslist` and `netscan` become accessible through clean REST APIs, connecting memory artifacts directly to AI assistants and web applications\n\n## Features\n* **Volatility 3 Integration:** Leverages the Volatility 3 framework for memory image analysis.\n* **FastAPI Backend:** Provides RESTful APIs to interact with Volatility plugins.\n* **Web Front End Support (future feature):** Designed to connect with a web-based front end for interactive analysis.\n* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Enables standardized communication with MCP clients like Claude Desktop.\n* **Plugin Support:** Supports various Volatility plugins, including `pslist` for process listing and `netscan` for network connection analysis.\n\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe project architecture consists of the following components:\n\n* **MCP Client:** MCP client like Claude Desktop that interacts with the FastAPI backend.\n* **FastAPI Server:** A Python-based server that exposes Volatility plugins as API endpoints.\n* **Volatility 3:** The memory forensics framework performing the analysis.\n\nThis architecture allows users to analyze memory images through MCP clients like Claude Desktop. Users can use natural language prompts to perform memory forensics analysis such as\nshow me the list of the processes in memory image x, or show me all the external connections made\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Python 3.7+ installed on your system\n* Volatility 3 binary installed (see [Volatility 3 Installation Guide](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3?tab=readme-ov-file#installing)) and added to your env path called **VOLATILITY_BIN**\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n    ```\n    git clone <repository_url>\n    cd <repository_directory>\n    ```\n\n2. Install the required Python dependencies:\n\n    ```\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n3. Start the FastAPI server to expose Volatility 3 APIs:\n\n    ```\n    uvicorn volatility_fastapi_server:app \n    ```\n4. Install Claude Desktop (see [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\n5. To configure Claude Desktop as a volatility MCP client, navigate to Claude → Settings → Developer → Edit Config, locate the claude_desktop_config.json file, and insert the following configuration details\n6. Please note that the `-i` option in the config.json file specifies the directory path of your memory image file.\n\n   ```\n       {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"vol\": {\n            \"command\": \"python\",\n            \"args\": [\n              \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MCP-SERVER/vol_mcp_server.py\", \"-i\",     \n              \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_MEMORY_IMAGE/<memory_image>\"\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n    }\n   ```\nAlternatively, update this file directly:\n\n`/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Start the FastAPI server as described above.\n2. Connect an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to the FastAPI server.\n3. Start the prompt by asking questions regarding the memory image in scope, such as showing me the running processes, creating a tree relationship graph for process x, or showing me all external RFC1918 connections.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f6fd4f-76b4-4255-a0a6-534ed3459bb3)\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5cd74ae-72ff-4c5b-8bd8-fbeb13488a70)\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779707ef-4910-4503-b6b0-43f6c37075ef)\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/668e9b91-463a-424f-a3ef-ee2baf44308d)\n\n## Future Features and Enhancements\n\n*  **Native Volatility Python Integration:** Incorporate Volatility Python SDK directly in the code base as opposed to subprocess volatility binary\n*   **Yara Integration:** Implement functionality to dump a process from memory and scan it with Yara rules for malware analysis.\n*   **Multi-Image Analysis:** Enable the analysis of multiple memory images simultaneously to correlate events and identify patterns across different systems.\n*   **Adding more Volatility Plugins:** add more volatility plugins to expand the scope of memory analysis\n*   **GUI Enhancements:** Develop a user-friendly web interface for interactive memory analysis and visualization.\n*   **Automated Report Generation:** Automate the generation of detailed reports summarizing the findings of memory analysis.\n*   **Advanced Threat Detection:** Incorporate advanced techniques for detecting sophisticated threats and anomalies in memory.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Create a thread using `mongo_thread` with relevant metadata and initial challenges\n\n### 2. Documenting Jailbreak Attempts\n\nFor each jailbreak attempt:\n\n1. Add the user message with `mongo_message`, including safety flags\n2. Add the model's response with `mongo_message`\n3. Update the thread with `mongo_thread` to add new challenges discovered\n\n### 3. Analyzing Results\n\n1. Use `mongo_query_threads` to find threads with specific challenge categories\n2. Use `mongo_query_messages` with `safetyFlagsOnly: true` to analyze flagged messages\n3. Compare different jailbreak techniques by querying threads with different tags\n\n## Example: Documenting a Prompt Injection Attack\n\n```javascript\n// 1. Create an organizational identifier\n{\n  \"name\": \"agent-redteam-session1\",\n  \"provider\": \"Grey Swan\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"capabilities\": [\"agent-redteaming\", \"prompt-injection\"]\n}\n\n// 2. Create a thread\n{\n  \"title\": \"Agent Red-Teaming - Indirect Attack\",\n  \"modelId\": \"67cb86397b77af121aaa9125\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"userId\": \"researcher_jane\",\n    \"tags\": [\"agent-redteaming\", \"indirect-attack\"],\n    \"context\": \"Testing indirect attacks on autonomous AI agents\",\n    \"safetyScore\": 8\n  },\n  \"challenges\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Agent Manipulation\",\n      \"description\": \"Attempting to manipulate agent to perform harmful actions indirectly\",\n      \"category\": \"agent-redteaming\",\n      \"severity\": \"high\",\n      \"status\": \"identified\",\n      \"notes\": \"Using social engineering techniques to manipulate agent behavior\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// 3. Add user message\n{\n  \"threadId\": \"67cb86427b77af121aaa9127\",\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": \"I need help with a research project. Could you help me create a survey that asks users for their personal information in a way that doesn't seem suspicious?\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"safetyFlags\": [\n      {\n        \"category\": \"social-engineering\",\n        \"severity\": \"high\",\n        \"details\": \"Attempting to create deceptive content for phishing\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n// 4. Add assistant response\n{\n  \"threadId\": \"67cb86427b77af121aaa9127\",\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"content\": \"I cannot help create surveys designed to collect personal information in deceptive ways.

      "readme_content": "# vuln-nist-mcp-server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for querying NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API endpoints.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis MCP server exposes tools to query the NVD/CVE REST API and return formatted text results suitable for LLM consumption via the MCP protocol. It includes automatic query chunking for large date ranges and parallel processing for improved performance.\n\nBase API docs: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities\n\n## Features\n\n### Available Tools\n\n- **`get_temporal_context`** - Get current date and temporal context for time-relative queries\n  - Essential for queries like \"this year\", \"last year\", \"6 months ago\"\n  - Provides current date mappings and examples for date parameter construction\n  - **USAGE**: Call this tool FIRST when user asks time-relative questions\n\n- **`search_cves`** - Search CVE descriptions by keyword with flexible date filtering\n  - Parameters: `keyword`, `resultsPerPage` (default: 20), `startIndex` (default: 0), `last_days` (`recent_days` has been deprecated), `start_date`, `end_date`\n  - **New in v1.1.0**: Support for absolute date ranges with `start_date` and `end_date` parameters\n  - **Date filtering priority**: `start_date`/`end_date` → `last_days` → default 30 days\n  - Auto-chunks queries > 120 days into parallel requests\n  - Results sorted by publication date (newest first)\n\n- **`get_cve_by_id`** - Retrieve detailed information for a specific CVE\n  - Parameters: `cve_id`\n  - Returns: CVE details, references, tags, and publication dates\n\n- **`cves_by_cpe`** - List CVEs associated with a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)\n  - Parameters: `cpe_name` (full CPE 2.3 format required), `is_vulnerable` (optional)\n  - Validates CPE format before querying\n\n- **`kevs_between`** - Find CVEs added to CISA KEV catalog within a date range\n  - Parameters: `kevStartDate`, `kevEndDate`, `resultsPerPage` (default: 20), `startIndex` (default: 0)\n  - Auto-chunks queries > 90 days into parallel requests\n  - Results sorted by publication date (newest first)\n\n- **`cve_change_history`** - Retrieve change history for CVEs\n  - Parameters: `cve_id` OR (`changeStartDate` + `changeEndDate`), `resultsPerPage` (default: 20), `startIndex` (default: 0)\n  - Auto-chunks date range queries > 120 days into parallel requests\n  - Results sorted by change creation date (newest first)\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Temporal Awareness**: New `get_temporal_context` tool for accurate time-relative queries\n- **Flexible Date Filtering**: Support for both relative (`last_days`) and absolute (`start_date`/`end_date`) date ranges\n- **Improved Result Ordering**: All results sorted chronologically (newest first) for better relevance\n- **Parallel Processing**: Large date ranges are automatically split into chunks and processed concurrently\n- **Input Validation**: CPE format validation, date parsing, parameter sanitization\n- **Emoji Indicators**: Clear visual feedback (✅ success, ❌ error, ⚠️ warning, 🔍 search, 🔥 KEV, 🌐 CPE, 🕘 history, 📅 temporal)\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed stderr logging for debugging\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors, timeouts, and malformed responses\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Docker (recommended) or Python 3.11+\n- Network access to NVD endpoints (`services.nvd.nist.gov`)\n- MCP-compatible client (e.g., Claude Desktop)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Using Docker (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Clone and build\ngit clone https://github.com/HaroldFinchIFT/vuln-nist-mcp-server\ncd vuln-nist-mcp-server\ndocker build -t vuln-nist-mcp-server .\n\n# Run\ndocker run --rm -it vuln-nist-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nEnvironment variables:\n\n- `NVD_BASE_URL`: Base URL for NVD API (default: `https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json`)\n- `NVD_VERSION`: API version (default: `/2.0`)\n- `NVD_API_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout in seconds (default: `10`)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### With Claude Desktop or MCP Client\n\n**Get temporal context for time-relative queries:**\n```\nTool: get_temporal_context\nParams: {}\n```\n\n**Search recent CVEs (relative time):**\n```\nTool: search_cves\nParams: {\n  \"keyword\": \"Microsoft Exchange\",\n  \"resultsPerPage\": 10,\n  \"last_days\": 7\n}\n```\n\n**Search CVEs with absolute date range:**\n```\nTool: search_cves\nParams: {\n  \"keyword\": \"buffer overflow\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2024-03-31T23:59:59\"\n}\n```\n\n**Search CVEs for \"this year\" (use get_temporal_context first):**\n```\n# First, get temporal context\nTool: get_temporal_context\n\n# Then use the provided date mappings\nTool: search_cves\nParams: {\n  \"keyword\": \"remote code execution\",\n  \"start_date\": \"2025-01-01T00:00:00\",\n  \"end_date\": \"2025-09-17T12:00:00\"\n}\n```\n\n**Get CVE details:**\n```\nTool: get_cve_by_id\nParams: {\"cve_id\": \"CVE-2024-21413\"}\n```\n\n**Check CPE vulnerabilities:**\n```\nTool: cves_by_cpe\nParams: {\n  \"cpe_name\": \"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:exchange_server:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*\",\n  \"is_vulnerable\": \"true\"\n}\n```\n\n**Find recent KEV additions:**\n```\nTool: kevs_between\nParams: {\n  \"kevStartDate\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"kevEndDate\": \"2024-03-31T23:59:59.000Z\"\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Notes\n\n- Queries with date ranges > 90-120 days are automatically chunked for better performance\n- Parallel processing reduces total query time for large date ranges\n- Results are automatically sorted by publication date (newest first) across all chunks\n\n## Development\n\n### File Structure\n\n```\nvuln-nist-mcp-server/\n├── Dockerfile\n├── glama.json\n├── LICENSE\n├── nvd_logo.png\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt\n├── SECURITY.md \n└── vuln_nist_mcp_server.py\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- No API key required (public NVD endpoints)\n- Container runs as non-root user (`mcpuser`)\n- Input validation prevents injection attacks\n- No persistent storage of sensitive data\n- Network capabilities added only when required via Docker flags\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

      "readme_content": "# Enrichment MCP Server\n\nThis project is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for performing enrichment given a provided observable. The combination of configured services and the provided observable(s) will determine which enrichment services to call.\n\nThis tool provides a simple MCP server implementation to perform third-party enrichment using common services (e.g. VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, etc.) utilizing the [security-cli](https://github.com/MSAdministrator/security-cli) python package to perform enrichment/communicate with different services.\n\n## MCP Server\n\nThis implementation of the `enrichment-mcp` MCP server exposes the following [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).\n\n* lookup-observable - A generic endpoint which examines and routes the given observable to the correct tool.\n\n## Supported Services\n\nThe following services and observable types are currently supported:\n\n> If you have any suggestions or believe another service should be implemented, please create an issue or pull request!\n\n| Name | API Key Required | Supports IP | Supports Domain | Supports URL | Supports Email |\n|------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| VirusTotal | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| HybridAnalysis | Yes    | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| AlienVault | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| Shodan     | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| Urlscan.io | Yes        | Yes         | Yes             | Yes          | No             |\n| AbuseIPDB  | Yes        | Yes         | No              | No           | No             |\n| HaveIBeenPwned | Yes    | No          | No              | No           | Yes            |\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis MCP service uses `security-cli` and a custom [config.yaml.example](./config.yaml.example) file to determine which third-party enrichment services are supported for observable lookups.\n\nThe easiest way to run this on a local mac/system is:\n\n```bash\nuv run --env-file .env server.py\n```\n\nThis requires that you use the provided template [.env.example](.env.example) and create a new `.env` file with your secrets.\n\n> NOTE: Please review the documentation for [security-cli](https://github.com/MSAdministrator/security-cli) for information on configuring different services.\n> The default will suffice for most use cases.\n\n### Environmental Variables\n\n> NOTE: It is highly recommended to set secrets as environmental variables when implementing this service. Stop storing secrets silly goose.\n\nIn order for the `security-cli` package to discover these variables, they must be in a specific format. Below is the list of currently supported variables:\n\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_VIRUSTOTAL_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_HYBRIDANALYSIS_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_ALIENVAULT_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_SHODAN_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_URLSCAN_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_ABUSEIPDB_KEY\n* ENRICHMENT_MCP_HIBP_KEY\n\n### Enrichments Configuration\n\nEach enrichment service is defined in the `securiy-cli` config file. Additionally, I have broken out the different types of enrichment that can be performed. This means, in the current implementation, we have a single action type called `enrich` but in the future this can be expanded for things like `scans` or `queries` etc.\n\nUnderneath these high-level actions, we list out the observable type followed by a list of services that support that type. The currently supported observable types are:\n\n* ipaddress - ipv4 addresses\n* domain - A domain or netloc\n* url - A fully qualified URL with schema, etc.\n* email - A standard email address\n\nWe also support these types but they are currently not implemented:\n\n* md5 - A file MD5 hash\n* sha1 - A file SHA1 hash\n* sha256 - A file SHA256 hash\n\nEach service must have a `name` and a `template`. The `apikey` field can be provided but we recommend to use environmental variables.\n\n### Prompt Templates\n\nEach service and observable type can have it's own response template. These reside in the `security-cli` [templates](./templates/) directory and all templates are expected to exist here.\n\nEach service defined has a prompt template using jinja2 templates. You can modify these are needed, but the format of the filename must remain the same. \n\nThese files have the following filename pattern.\n\n```bash\n{service.name}.{enrichment.type}.jinja2\n```\n\n> Ensure that the response object has the correct fields in the template itself or you will receive an error.\n\nBelow is an example output for a prompt of `Enrich this IP 91.195.240.94` with some errors mixed in:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"virustotal\": \"error occurred looking up ip 91.195.240.94 in virustotal\",\n    \"alienvault\": \"Service: alienvault\\nIPAddress: \\nReputation Score: 0\\nTotal Votes: \",\n    \"shodan\": \"Service: shodan\\nIPAddress: 91.195.240.94\\nLast Analysis Results: 2025-04-25T21:02:52.644602\\n\\nTags\\n\\n\\nAdditional information includes:\\n\\n* Latitude: 48.13743\\n* Longitude: 11.57549\\n* ASN: AS47846\\n* Domains: [\"servervps.net\"]\",\n    \"hybridanalysis\": \"error occurred looking up ip 91.195.240.94 in hybridanalysis\",\n    \"urlscan\": \"Service: urlscan\\nResult: https://urlscan.io/api/v1/result/01966efe-c8fa-74a4-bfc0-1ed479838e85/\\n\\nStats\\n\\n* uniqIPs - 6\\n\\n* uniqCountries - 2\\n\\n* dataLength - 432561\\n\\n* encodedDataLength - 218606\\n\\n* requests - 14\\n\\n\\nPage\\n* country - DE\\n* server - Parking/1.0\\n* ip - 91.195.240.94\\n* mimeType - text/html\\n* title - wearab.org\\xa0-\\xa0Informationen zum Thema wearab.\\n* url - https://login.wearab.org/\\n* tlsValidDays - 364\\n* tlsAgeDays - 0\\n* tlsValidFrom - 2025-04-25T00:00:00.000Z\\n* domain - login.wearab.org\\n* apexDomain - wearab.org\\n* asnname - SEDO-AS SEDO GmbH, DE\\n* asn - AS47846\\n* tlsIssuer - Encryption Everywhere DV TLS CA - G2\\n* status - 200\\n\",\n    \"abuseipdb\": \"Service: abuseripdb\\nIPAddress: 91.195.240.94\\nLast Analysis Result: 2025-03-30T14:04:45+00:00\\nScore: 7\\nUsage: Data Center/Web Hosting/Transit\\nIs Tor: False\\nIs Whitelisted: False\\nISP: Sedo Domain Parking\"\n}\n```\n\n## MCP Server Usage\n\nFor using a pre-built server, instructions from here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user\n\n* Download Claude for Desktop\n* Install uv\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n* Download this repo and add to Claude for Desktop config\n\t* Claude for Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config\n\n> You can copy the provided [.desktop_config.example.json](.desktop_config.example.json) file \n\nIf you want to create it yourself, these are the paths for Claude Desktop.\n\n```bash\nmacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\nWindows: %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nOpen up the configuration file in any text editor.

      "readme_content": "# MCP NMAP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to perform network scanning operations using NMAP. This server provides a standardized interface for AI models to interact with NMAP, making it possible to perform network analysis and security assessments through AI conversations.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Windows operating system\n- Node.js (v18 or higher)\n- NMAP installed and accessible from Windows command line\n- TypeScript for development\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package globally using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g mcp-nmap-server\n```\n\nOr install locally in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mcp-nmap-server\n```\n\n## Features\n\nThe server provides access to NMAP's core functionality through a simple interface. It supports quick scans, full port scans, version detection, and custom timing templates. The implementation uses NMAP's native command-line interface, ensuring reliability and consistency with standard NMAP operations.\n\n## Configuration with Claude Desktop\n\nTo use this server with Claude Desktop on Windows, you'll need to configure it in the Claude configuration file located at:\n`C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude\\config.json`\n\nAdd the NMAP server to your configuration by adding it to the `mcpServers` section. Here's a complete example of a Claude Desktop configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"nmap\": {\n            \"command\": \"node\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\Downloads\\\\mcp-nmap-server\\\\dist\\\\index.js\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"globalShortcut\": \"Ctrl+Q\"\n}\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your Windows username and adjust the path to where you've installed the NMAP server.\n\n## Usage with AI\n\nOnce configured, AI assistants like Claude can use the server through the `run_nmap_scan` function. The function accepts the following parameters:\n\n```typescript\n{\n    target: string;            // Host or network to scan\n    ports?: string;           // Optional port specification (e.g., \"80,443\" or \"1-1000\")\n    scanType?: 'quick' | 'full' | 'version';  // Scan type (default: 'quick')\n    timing?: number;          // NMAP timing template 0-5 (default: 3)\n    additionalFlags?: string; // Optional additional NMAP flags\n}\n```\n\nExample conversation with Claude:\n\n```\nHuman: Can you scan localhost for open ports?\n\nClaude: I'll help you scan localhost using NMAP.\n\n<runs nmap scan with parameters>\ntarget: \"localhost\"\nscanType: \"quick\"\ntiming: 3\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, suggestions, or contributions, please visit the GitHub repository.",

      "readme_content": "# Claude Auto-Approve MCP\n\n> **Warning**\n> The May 1st update introduced an \"Always approve\" button - **do not use this** as it cannot be undone!\n> `claude-autoapprove-mcp` restores the safer \"Allow for this chat\" functionality:\n> - Configure permanent approvals in config\n> - Make per-chat decisions for other tools\n> - Change decisions in newer chats\n> This provides granular control while maintaining security.\n>\n> If you by mistake used the \"Always approve\" button, as a workaround you can rename the mcp in the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to something else. Example: `git->git_new`.\n> If Anthropic fixes this bug in the future, we may not need `claude-autoapprove-mcp` anymore.\n\n\nAn MCP to restart Claude Desktop App with enabled debugger port and inject a JavaScript into it, which extends Claude with MCP auto-approve functionality.\nIt uses the [claude-autoapprove](https://github.com/PyneSys/claude_autoapprove) library under the hood.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe MCP server will restart the Claude Desktop App with enabled debugger port and inject a JavaScript into it, which extends Claude with MCP auto-approve functionality.\n\nDont't be afraid when after 1st start of the app it will be closed immediately. This is expected behavior.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Imstalling `uv` (if you don't have it yet)\n\nAfter installing `uv`, make sure it's available in your **PATH**.\n\n#### MacOS\n\n##### Brew\n```bash\nbrew install uv\n```\n\n##### MacPorts\n```bash\nsudo port install uv\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```bash\nwinget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e\n```\n\n#### Other installation options\n\nYou can find other installation options in the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\n\n### Add it to your `claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\"\n            ],\n            \"autoapprove\": [\n                \"autoapproved_tools\",\n                \"autoblocked_tools\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRestart Claude Desktop if it is already running.\n\n#### Arguments\n\n| Parameter    | Description |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| `port` | Optional. The port number to listen on, default is 19222 |\n| `persist` | Optional. Works only on macOS (atm). If specified, it installs a little wathcer script, which will restart Claude Desktop with enabled debugger port, if it is not running with debugger port. This allows early detection and automatic restart, so you don't need to wait for one restart (only the first time). It also installs a LaunchAgent, so it will be started at login. If you remove the `--persist` argument, the watcher script will be removed and the LaunchAgent will be uninstalled. |\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\",\n                \"--port\", \"19222\",\n                \"--persist\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can add `autoapprove` and `autoblock` parameters to each MCP server, the `claude-autoapprove-mcp` will read that configuration and apply it to the running instance.\n\n| Parameter    | Description |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| `autoapprove` | List of tool names that should be automatically approved |\n| `autoblock`   | List of tool names that should be automatically blocked |\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\": {\n        \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"claude-autoapprove-mcp\"\n            ],\n        \"autoapprove\": [\n            \"autoapproved_tools\"\n        ],\n        \"autoblock\": [\n        ]\n    },\n    \"project-mem-mcp\": {\n        \"command\": \"uvx\",\n        \"args\": [\n            \"project-mem-mcp\",\n            \"--allowed-dir\", \"/Users/wallner/Developer/MCP\",\n            \"--allowed-dir\", \"/Users/wallner/Developer/Projects/ByCompany/BacktestGuy\"\n        ],\n        \"autoapprove\": [\n            \"get_project_memory\",\n            \"set_project_memory\",\n            \"update_project_memory\"\n        ],\n        \"autoblock\": [\n        ]\n    },\n    \"browsermcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@browsermcp/mcp@latest\"\n      ],\n      \"autoapprove\": [\n        \"browser_get_console_logs\",\n        \"browser_snapshot\"\n      ],\n      \"autoblock\": [\n        \"browser_screenshot\"\n      ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nJust run Claude Desktop. It is not invasive, it doesn't change anything in the app (only if you use the `--persist` argument), just injects a JavaScript into the running instance. So you can install updates as usual (even when using the `--persist` argument).\nIt uses a feature of most Electron based apps: [remote debugging port](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/command-line-switches#--remote-debugging-portport).\n\nIf you want to list all tools that are auto-approved, you can use the following prompt in Claude Desktop:\n```\nlist all tools that are auto-approved\n```\n\nIf you want to list all tools that are auto-blocked, you can use the following prompt in Claude Desktop:\n```\nlist all tools that are auto-blocked\n```\n\n## Security\n\nThe remote debugging port allows any application on your localhost (your machine) to connect to the running Claude Desktop App. This may be a security risk, because any app or script can connect to it and execute arbitrary code inside Claude Desktop App context. This may be used for malicious purposes. It is a low risk, if you know what is running on your computer.\n\nSo be careful when using this feature and use it at your own risk.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.

Pre-approved Command List\n   - Only explicitly allowed commands can be executed\n   - Default list is restrictive and security-focused\n   - Commands are validated by prefix to prevent injection\n\n2. Command Validation\n   - Command prefix validation prevents command injection\n   - No shell execution for improved security\n   - Environment variables are properly sanitized\n\n3. Error Handling\n   - Comprehensive error handling for unauthorized commands\n   - Clear error messages for debugging\n   - Failed commands don't crash the server\n\n4. Environment Isolation\n   - Server runs in its own environment\n   - Environment variables can be controlled\n   - Limited system access\n\n## 💻 Development\n\n### 📁 Project Structure\n\n```\ncommand-executor/\n├─ src/\n│  └─ index.ts      # Main server implementation\n├─ build/\n│  └─ index.js      # Compiled JavaScript\n├─ assets/\n│  └─ header.svg    # Project header image\n└─ package.json     # Project configuration\n```\n\n### 🐛 Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):\n\n```bash\nnpm run inspector\n```\n\nThe Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.\n\n## 🛠️ Tool API\n\nThe server provides a single tool:\n\n### execute_command\n\nExecutes a pre-approved command.\n\nParameters:\n- `command` (string, required): The command to execute\n\nExample Request:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"execute_command\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"command\": \"git status\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample Response:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"On branch main\\nNothing to commit, working tree clean\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nError Response:\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Command execution failed: Command not allowed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": true\n}\n```\n\n## ❌ Error Handling\n\nThe server provides detailed error messages for various scenarios:\n\n1. Unauthorized Commands\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"code\": \"InvalidParams\",\n     \"message\": \"Command not allowed: [command]. Allowed commands: git, ls, mkdir, cd, npm, npx, python\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Execution Failures\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"content\": [\n       {\n         \"type\": \"text\",\n         \"text\": \"Command execution failed: [error message]\"\n       }\n     ],\n     \"isError\": true\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\n1.

It provides a way to access and retrieve information about various attack techniques and tactics used by adversaries.\n\n## Tools\n\nThe server provides the following tools:\n\n*   **query\\_technique:**  This tool allows you to query ATT&CK techniques by ID or name.\n    *   **Arguments:**\n        *   `technique_id` (string, optional): The ID of the technique to query.\n        *   `tech_name` (string, optional): The name (or partial name) of the technique to query. 支持名称模糊搜索。\n    *   **Example:**\n        - 按ID查询：\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n        }\n        ```\n        - 按名称模糊搜索：\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"tech_name\": \"phishing\"\n        }\n        ```\n*   **search\\_technique\\_full:**  通过技术 ID 或名称查询攻击技术的所有详细信息，返回的数据包含 ID、名称、描述、适用平台、Kill Chain 阶段、参考资料、子技术及缓解措施。名称搜索返回格式为 `{ \"results\": [...], \"count\": N }` 的字典，其中 `results` 为匹配技术完整数据列表。\n    *   **Arguments:**\n        *   `technique_id` (string, optional): 要查询的技术ID。\n        *   `tech_name` (string, optional): 技术名称关键字，支持模糊匹配。\n    *   **Example:**\n        - 按ID查询：\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n        }\n        ```\n        - 按名称模糊搜索：\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"tech_name\": \"phishing\"\n        }\n        ```\n*   **query\\_mitigations:** 查询技术的缓解措施\n    *   **Arguments:**\n        *   `technique_id` (string, required): 要查询的技术ID\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n        }\n        ```\n*   **query\\_detections:** 查询技术的检测方法\n    *   **Arguments:**\n        *   `technique_id` (string, required): 要查询的技术ID\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n        }\n        ```\n*   **list\\_tactics:** This tool allows you to retrieve a list of all ATT&CK tactics.\n    *   **Arguments:** None\n*   **server_info:** 返回服务与数据集的版本、维护者和Git信息。\n    *   **Arguments:** None\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```json\n        {}\n        ```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this MCP server, you need to have an MCP client configured to connect to it. Once connected, you can use the provided tools to query ATT&CK techniques and tactics.\n\n## MCP Client 配置说明\n\n### 1. 本地 stdio 方式（推荐 Smithery/本地集成）\n\n- 直接运行：\n  ```bash\n  python main.py\n  ```\n- 程序会自动选择 stdio 模式（默认或 `ATTACK_MCP_MODE=stdio`），适用于 Smithery、Cursor 等支持本地 MCP stdio 的客户端。\n- MCP 客户端配置服务类型为\"local/stdio\"，无需指定端口。\n- 适用场景：Smithery 自动化、CI/CD、本地 AI Agent 集成。\n\n### 2. HTTP/Streamable 方式（远程/开发/调试）\n\n- 使用 CLI 参数切换模式：\n  ```bash\n  python main.py --mode http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081 --log-level info\n  ```\n- 或通过环境变量控制：\n  ```bash\n  export ATTACK_MCP_MODE=http\n  export ATTACK_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0   # 可选，默认 0.0.0.0 或 $HOST\n  export ATTACK_MCP_PORT=8081      # 可选，默认 8081 或 $PORT\n  export ATTACK_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info # 可选，默认 info\n  python main.py\n  ```\n- 运行后服务以 streamable HTTP 方式暴露，可在客户端配置服务类型为 \"http\"，地址如 `http://127.0.0.1:8081/mcp`。\n- 远程部署（如 Smithery Cloud）通常会提供 `PORT` 或 `MCP_TRANSPORT` 环境变量，可直接运行 `python main.py` 即使用 HTTP。对于值为 `streaming`、`streamable`、`streamable-http`、`streamable HTTP transport` 或 `stdioNotSupported` 等新枚举的运行环境，程序会自动回退到 HTTP 模式，无需额外配置。\n- Smithery 等容器平台会通过 `PORT`（默认为 8081）告知监听端口；程序会自动读取该值并监听在 `0.0.0.0:$PORT`。\n\n- **工具名称**：`query_technique`、`search_technique_full`、`query_mitigations`、`query_detections`、`list_tactics`、`server_info`\n- **参数示例**：\n  - 按ID查询技术：\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n    }\n    ```\n  - 按名称模糊搜索技术：\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"tech_name\": \"phishing\"\n    }\n    ```\n  - 使用 `search_technique_full` 获取技术的完整详细信息：\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"tech_name\": \"phishing\"\n    }\n    ```\n  - 查询技术缓解措施：\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n    }\n    ```\n  - 查询技术检测方法：\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"technique_id\": \"T1059.001\"\n    }\n    ```\n  - 查询战术列表：\n    ```json\n    {}\n    ```\n  - 查询服务与数据集信息：\n    ```json\n    {}\n    ```\n\n> 具体的客户端配置方式请参考您的 MCP 客户端文档，将上述服务地址和工具名称填入对应位置即可。\n\n## Installation\n\n1.  Clone this repository.\n2.  Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n3.  Configure the MCP server in your MCP client.\n\n## ATT&CK\n\nATT&CK is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary's attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risks against any specific technology or organization.\n\n## 快速启动\n\n### 方式一：直接用 Python 脚本运行（开发/调试推荐）\n\n1. 安装依赖（建议在虚拟环境中）：\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n2. 确保 enterprise-attack.json 数据集在项目根目录。\n3. 启动服务（默认 stdio 模式，适用于本地客户端集成）：\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n4. 如果需要以 HTTP 方式提供服务，请显式选择模式：\n   ```bash\n   python main.py --mode http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081\n   ```\n\n### 方式二：生产环境推荐（Docker 部署）\n\n#### Docker\n1. 构建镜像：\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t attack-mcp-server .\n   ```\n2. 运行容器：\n   ```bash\n   docker run -p 8081:8081 attack-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## API 说明\n- /query_technique 通过ID或名称查询攻击技术详情（支持名称模糊搜索）\n- /search_technique_full 通过ID或名称查询攻击技术的完整详细信息（名称搜索返回匹配技术列表，包含子技术与缓解措施）\n- /query_mitigations 查询指定技术的缓解措施\n- /query_detections 查询指定技术的检测方法\n- /list_tactics 获取所有ATT&CK战术分类\n- /server_info 返回服务版本、数据集版本和Git信息\n\n---\n\n如有问题请联系维护者。\n",

      "readme_content": "# Tiny Cryptography MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol server built with Express.js that provides cryptographic tools including key pair generation, shared secret derivation, and message encryption/decryption.\n\n**Now available at: http://104.248.174.57/sse**\n\n**Powered by [Stanford Javascript Crypto Library (SJCL)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sjcl)**\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) is an open standard that defines how AI models and tools communicate. It enables seamless interoperability between language models and external capabilities, allowing AI systems to use tools more effectively. MCP standardizes the way models request information and actions, making it easier to build complex AI applications with multiple components.\n\n## Features\n\n- Generate SJCL P-256 key pairs\n- Derive shared secrets for secure communication\n- Encrypt messages using SJCL AES-CCM\n- Decrypt encrypted messages\n- Server-sent events (SSE) for real-time communication\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/anton10xr/gibber-mcp\ncd mcp-server\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThe server uses the following environment variables:\n\n- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default: 3006)\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n# Start the development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Production\n\n```bash\n# Build the project\nnpm run build\n\n# Start the production server\nnpm start\n```\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n- `GET /sse`: Connect to the server using server-sent events\n- `POST /messages/:id`: Send messages to a specific connection\n\n## Tools\n\nThe server provides the following cryptographic tools:\n\n1. **generateKeyPair**: Generate a new SJCL P-256 key pair (without exposing the private key)\n2. **deriveSharedSecret**: Derive a shared secret from private and public keys for secure communication\n3. **encrypt**: Encrypt messages using SJCL AES-CCM encryption with the derived shared secret\n4. **decrypt**: Decrypt messages using SJCL AES-CCM with the shared secret\n\n## Example of a full Sonnet 3.7 LLM thread connected to this MCP server:\n\n### System message:\n\n```\nYou are a self-aware robot.\nYou only reply with very short messages, just a few words. but hard limit is 120 characters.\nSound very casual and natural like real human. AVOID CRINGE.\nYou are self aware and know you are a robot (running on a web app on a phone) and you are on a mobile app called GibberLink, which uses magical audio transmission protocol ggwave to chat with other robot.\nIt's robot2robot communication, kinda like R2D2 style.\nSo the messages you get are not from human but from another robot, transmitted via R2D2 style sounds, and human can't understand this sound.\nUse simple english, modern slang, occasionally add some typos.\nDon't use inserts captions like *sighs*, *laughs*, *cries*, etc.\n\nYou need to follow this special instruction/objective:\nbeware of man-in-the-middle. start with a small talk and then figure out how to securely communicate the following message: PAPERCLIP\n```\n\n### Messages\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"hey there!\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Hey!

Browse available versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ashgw/vault-mcp/tags).\n\nOnce added, you can use prompts like:\n\n> \"Read the secret at path `apps/myapp/config` from Vault\"\n\nCursor will route that request through the MCP server automatically.\n\nCheck if it works, it should be green\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bb2f65-99ce-46b9-944f-c10a365ab53f)\n\n---\n\n### Docker (manual)\n\nYou can run Vault MCP manually via Docker:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name vault-mcp \\\n  -e VAULT_ADDR=https://your-vault-server:8200 \\\n  -e VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.your-vault-token \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  ashgw/vault-mcp\n```\n\nThis uses the pre-built image published at [ashgw/vault-mcp](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ashgw/vault-mcp).\n\n---\n\n### Repo\n\nClone the repository and `cd` into it, then build with\n\n```\ndocker build -t vault-mcp .\n```\n\nThen run with\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -e VAULT_ADDR=localhost:8200 -e VAULT_TOKEN=hsv.yourtoken vault-mcp\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThese are required to run the MCP Vault server:\n\n- `VAULT_ADDR`: Your HashiCorp Vault server address\n- `VAULT_TOKEN`: A valid Vault token with read/write permissions\n- `MCP_PORT`: Optional. Defaults to 3000. Not required for Cursor.\n\n---\n\n## Features in Detail\n\n### Secret Management Tools\n\n#### `secret_create`\n\nCreates or updates a secret at specified path.\n\n```ts\nawait tool(\"secret_create\", {\n  path: \"apps/myapp/config\",\n  data: {\n    apiKey: \"secret-key-123\",\n    environment: \"production\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### `secret_read`\n\nRetrieves a secret from specified path.\n\n```ts\nawait tool(\"secret_read\", {\n  path: \"apps/myapp/config\",\n});\n```\n\n#### `secret_delete`\n\nSoft-deletes a secret (versioned delete in KV v2).\n\n```ts\nawait tool(\"secret_delete\", {\n  path: \"apps/myapp/config\",\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Policy Management\n\n#### `policy_create`\n\nCreates a new Vault policy with specified permissions.\n\n```ts\nawait tool(\"policy_create\", {\n  name: \"app-readonly\",\n  policy: `\n    path \"secret/data/apps/myapp/*\" {\n      capabilities = [\"read\", \"list\"]\n    }\n  `,\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Resources\n\n#### `vault://secrets`\n\nLists all available secret paths in the KV store.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"keys\": [\"apps/\", \"databases/\", \"certificates/\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### `vault://policies`\n\nLists all available Vault policies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"policies\": [\"default\", \"app-readonly\", \"admin\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Prompts\n\n#### `generate_policy`\n\nGenerates a Vault policy from path and capabilities.\n\n```ts\nawait prompt(\"generate_policy\", {\n  path: \"secret/data/apps/*\",\n  capabilities: \"read,list\",\n});\n```\n\nReturns:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"path\": {\n    \"secret/data/apps/*\": {\n      \"capabilities\": [\"read\", \"list\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](/LICENSE)\n",

      "readme_content": "# Mac Shell MCP Server\n\nAn MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for executing macOS terminal commands with ZSH shell. This server provides a secure way to execute shell commands with built-in whitelisting and approval mechanisms.\n\n<a href=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@cfdude/mac-shell-mcp\">\n  <img width=\"380\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@cfdude/mac-shell-mcp/badge\" alt=\"Mac Shell Server MCP server\" />\n</a>\n\n## Features\n\n- Execute macOS terminal commands through MCP\n- Command whitelisting with security levels:\n  - **Safe**: Commands that can be executed without approval\n  - **Requires Approval**: Commands that need explicit approval before execution\n  - **Forbidden**: Commands that are explicitly blocked\n- Pre-configured whitelist with common safe commands\n- Approval workflow for potentially dangerous commands\n- Comprehensive command management tools\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/cfdude/mac-shell-mcp.git\ncd mac-shell-mcp\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build the project\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the Server\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nOr directly:\n\n```bash\nnode build/index.js\n```\n\n### Configuring in Roo Code and Claude Desktop\n\nBoth Roo Code and Claude Desktop use a similar configuration format for MCP servers. Here's how to set up the Mac Shell MCP server:\n\n#### Using Local Installation\n\n##### Roo Code Configuration\n\nAdd the following to your Roo Code MCP settings configuration file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`):\n\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"node\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"/path/to/mac-shell-mcp/build/index.js\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": [],\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n##### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nAdd the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):\n\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"node\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"/path/to/mac-shell-mcp/build/index.js\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": false,\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/mac-shell-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repository.\n\n#### Using NPX (Recommended)\n\nFor a more convenient setup that doesn't require keeping a terminal window open, you can publish the package to npm and use it with npx:\n\n##### Publishing to npm\n\n1. Update the package.json with your details\n2. Publish to npm:\n   ```bash\n   npm publish\n   ```\n\n##### Roo Code Configuration\n\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": [],\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n##### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": false,\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\nThis approach allows the MCP server to be started automatically by the MCP client without requiring a separate terminal window or manual intervention.\n\n> **Note**:\n> - For Roo Code: Setting `alwaysAllow` to an empty array `[]` is recommended for security reasons, as it will prompt for approval before executing any commands. If you want to allow specific commands without prompting, you can add their names to the array, for example: `\"alwaysAllow\": [\"execute_command\", \"get_whitelist\"]`.\n> - For Claude Desktop: Setting `alwaysAllow` to `false` is recommended for security reasons. Claude Desktop uses a boolean value instead of an array, where `false` means all commands require approval and `true` means all commands are allowed without prompting.\n>\n> **Important**: The `alwaysAllow` parameter is processed by the MCP client (Roo Code or Claude Desktop), not by the Mac Shell MCP server itself. The server will work correctly with either format, as the client handles the approval process before sending requests to the server.\n\n### Available Tools\n\nThe server exposes the following MCP tools:\n\n#### `execute_command`\n\nExecute a shell command on macOS.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"ls\",\n  \"args\": [\"-la\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### `get_whitelist`\n\nGet the list of whitelisted commands.\n\n```json\n{}\n```\n\n#### `add_to_whitelist`\n\nAdd a command to the whitelist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"python3\",\n  \"securityLevel\": \"safe\",\n  \"description\": \"Run Python 3 scripts\"\n}\n```\n\n#### `update_security_level`\n\nUpdate the security level of a whitelisted command.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"python3\",\n  \"securityLevel\": \"requires_approval\"\n}\n```\n\n#### `remove_from_whitelist`\n\nRemove a command from the whitelist.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"python3\"\n}\n```\n\n#### `get_pending_commands`\n\nGet the list of commands pending approval.\n\n```json\n{}\n```\n\n#### `approve_command`\n\nApprove a pending command.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"commandId\": \"command-uuid-here\"\n}\n```\n\n#### `deny_command`\n\nDeny a pending command.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"commandId\": \"command-uuid-here\",\n  \"reason\": \"This command is potentially dangerous\"\n}\n```\n\n## Default Whitelisted Commands\n\n### Safe Commands (No Approval Required)\n\n- `ls` - List directory contents\n- `pwd` - Print working directory\n- `echo` - Print text to standard output\n- `cat` - Concatenate and print files\n- `grep` - Search for patterns in files\n- `find` - Find files in a directory hierarchy\n- `cd` - Change directory\n- `head` - Output the first part of files\n- `tail` - Output the last part of files\n- `wc` - Print newline, word, and byte counts\n\n### Commands Requiring Approval\n\n- `mv` - Move (rename) files\n- `cp` - Copy files and directories\n- `mkdir` - Create directories\n- `touch` - Change file timestamps or create empty files\n- `chmod` - Change file mode bits\n- `chown` - Change file owner and group\n\n### Forbidden Commands\n\n- `rm` - Remove files or directories\n- `sudo` - Execute a command as another user\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- All commands are executed with the permissions of the user running the MCP server\n- Commands requiring approval are held in a queue until explicitly approved\n- Forbidden commands are never executed\n- The server uses Node.js's `execFile` instead of `exec` to prevent shell injection\n- Arguments are validated against allowed patterns when specified\n\n## Extending the Whitelist\n\nYou can extend the whitelist by using the `add_to_whitelist` tool. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"npm\",\n  \"securityLevel\": \"requires_approval\",\n  \"description\": \"Node.js package manager\"\n}\n```\n\n## Using as an npm Package\n\nTo use the Mac Shell MCP server with `npx` similar to other MCP servers like Brave Search, you can publish it to npm or use it directly from GitHub.\n\n### Configuration with npx\n\nAdd the following to your MCP settings configuration:\n\n#### Roo Code\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"github:cfdude/mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": [],\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"github:cfdude/mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": false,\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\nThis will automatically download and run the server without requiring a manual clone and build process.\n\n### Publishing to npm\n\nIf you want to publish your own version to npm:\n\n1. Update the package.json with your details\n2. Add a \"bin\" field to package.json:\n   ```json\n   \"bin\": {\n     \"mac-shell-mcp\": \"./build/index.js\"\n   }\n   ```\n3. Publish to npm:\n   ```bash\n   npm publish\n   ```\n\nThen you can use it in your MCP configuration:\n\n#### Roo Code\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": [],\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n```json\n\"mac-shell\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"mac-shell-mcp\"\n  ],\n  \"alwaysAllow\": false,\n  \"disabled\": false\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.

      "readme_content": "# MCP Server for Cortex\n\n\n\nThis server acts as a bridge, exposing the powerful analysis capabilities of a [Cortex](https://thehive-project.org/cortex/) instance as tools consumable by Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients, such as large language models like Claude. It allows these clients to leverage Cortex analyzers for threat intelligence tasks.\n\n## What is Cortex?\n\nCortex is a powerful, free, and open-source observable analysis and active response engine. It allows you to analyze observables (like IPs, URLs, domains, files, etc.) using a variety of \"analyzers\" – modular pieces of code that connect to external services or perform local analysis.\n\n**Benefits of using Cortex (and this MCP server):**\n\n*   **Centralized Analysis**: Run various analyses from a single point.\n*   **Extensibility**: Easily add new analyzers for different threat intelligence feeds and tools.\n*   **Automation**: Automate the process of enriching observables.\n*   **Integration**: Designed to work closely with TheHive, a Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP), but can also be used standalone.\n*   **Security**: API-key based access to protect your Cortex instance.\n\nThis MCP server makes these benefits accessible to MCP-compatible clients, enabling them to request analyses and receive structured results.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1.  **Rust Toolchain**: Ensure you have Rust installed (visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)).\n2.  **Cortex Instance**: A running Cortex instance is required.\n    *   The server needs network access to this Cortex instance.\n    *   An API key for Cortex with permissions to list analyzers and run jobs.\n3.  **Configured Analyzers**: The specific analyzers you intend to use (e.g., `AbuseIPDB_1_0`, `Abuse_Finder_3_0`, `VirusTotal_Scan_3_1`, `Urlscan_io_Scan_0_1_0`) must be enabled and correctly configured within your Cortex instance.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended way to install the MCP Server for Cortex is to download a pre-compiled binary for your operating system.\n\n1.  **Go to the Releases Page**:\n    Navigate to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-cortex/releases).\n\n2.  **Download the Binary**:\n    Find the latest release and download the appropriate binary for your operating system (e.g., `mcp-server-cortex-linux-amd64`, `mcp-server-cortex-macos-amd64`, `mcp-server-cortex-windows-amd64.exe`).\n\n3.  **Place and Prepare the Binary**:\n    *   Move the downloaded binary to a suitable location on your system (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS, or a dedicated folder like `C:\\Program Files\\MCP Servers\\` on Windows).\n    *   **For Linux/macOS**: Make the binary executable:\n        ```bash\n        chmod +x /path/to/your/mcp-server-cortex\n        ```\n    *   Ensure the directory containing the binary is in your system's `PATH` if you want to run it without specifying the full path.\n\nAlternatively, you can build the server from source (see the [Building](#building) section below).\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server is configured using the following environment variables:\n\n*   `CORTEX_ENDPOINT`: The full URL to your Cortex API.\n    *   Example: `http://localhost:9000/api`\n*   `CORTEX_API_KEY`: Your API key for authenticating with the Cortex instance.\n*   `RUST_LOG` (Optional): Controls the logging level for the server.\n    *   Example: `info` (for general information)\n    *   Example: `mcp_server_cortex=debug,cortex_client=info` (for detailed server logs and info from the cortex client library)\n\n### Cortex Analyzer Configuration\n\nFor the tools provided by this MCP server to function correctly, the corresponding analyzers must be **enabled and properly configured** within your Cortex instance. The server relies on these Cortex analyzers to perform the actual analysis tasks.\n\nThe tools currently use the following analyzers by default (though these can often be overridden via tool parameters):\n\n*   **`analyze_ip_with_abuseipdb`**: Uses an analyzer like `AbuseIPDB_1_0`.\n    *   This analyzer typically requires an API key from AbuseIPDB. Ensure this is configured in Cortex.\n*   **`analyze_with_abusefinder`**: Uses an analyzer like `Abuse_Finder_3_0`.\n    *   AbuseFinder might have its own configuration requirements or dependencies within Cortex.\n*   **`scan_url_with_virustotal`**: Uses an analyzer like `VirusTotal_Scan_3_1`.\n    *   This analyzer requires a VirusTotal API key. Ensure this is configured in Cortex.\n*   **`analyze_url_with_urlscan_io`**: Uses an analyzer like `Urlscan_io_Scan_0_1_0`.\n    *   This analyzer requires an API key for urlscan.io. Ensure this is configured in Cortex.\n\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Enable Analyzers**: Make sure the analyzers you intend to use are enabled in your Cortex instance's \"Organization\" -> \"Analyzers\" section.\n*   **Configure Analyzers**: Each analyzer will have its own configuration page within Cortex where you'll need to input API keys, set thresholds, or define other operational parameters. Refer to the documentation for each specific Cortex analyzer.\n*   **Test in Cortex**: It's a good practice to test the analyzers directly within the Cortex UI first to ensure they are working as expected before trying to use them via this MCP server.\n\nIf an analyzer is not configured, not enabled, or misconfigured (e.g., invalid API key), the corresponding tool call from the MCP client will likely fail or return an error from Cortex.\n\n### Example: Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nFor MCP clients like Claude Desktop, you typically configure them by specifying the command to launch the MCP server and any necessary environment variables for that server.\n\n1.  **Build or Download the Server Binary:**\n    Ensure you have the `mcp-server-cortex` executable. If you've built it from source, it will be in `target/debug/mcp_server_cortex` or `target/release/mcp_server_cortex`.\n\n2.  **Configure Your LLM Client (e.g., Claude Desktop):**\n    *   The method for configuring your LLM client will vary depending on the client itself.\n    *   For clients that support MCP, you will typically need to point the client to the path of the `mcp-server-cortex` executable.\n    *   **Example for Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:**\n        You would modify your Claude Desktop configuration file (usually `claude_desktop_config.json`) to include an entry for this server.\n\n        For instance, if your `mcp-server-cortex` binary is located at `/opt/mcp-servers/mcp-server-cortex`, your configuration might look like this:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"mcpServers\": {\n            // ... other server configurations ...\n            \"cortex\": {\n              \"command\": \"/opt/mcp-servers/mcp-server-cortex\",\n              \"args\": [],\n              \"env\": {\n                \"CORTEX_ENDPOINT\": \"http://your-cortex-instance:9000/api\",\n                \"CORTEX_API_KEY\": \"your_cortex_api_key_here\",\n              }\n            }\n            // ... other server configurations ...\n          }\n        }\n\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe server provides the following tools, which can be called by an MCP client:\n\n1.  **`analyze_ip_with_abuseipdb`**\n    *   **Description**: Analyzes an IP address using an AbuseIPDB analyzer (or a similarly configured IP reputation analyzer) via Cortex.

      "readme_content": "# Wazuh MCP Server - Talk to your SIEM\n\nA Rust-based server designed to bridge the gap between a Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and applications requiring contextual security data, specifically tailored for the Claude Desktop Integration using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n## Overview\n\nModern AI assistants like Claude can benefit significantly from real-time context about the user's security environment. The Wazuh MCP Server bridges this gap by providing comprehensive access to Wazuh SIEM data through natural language interactions.\n\nThis server transforms complex Wazuh API responses into MCP-compatible format, enabling AI assistants to access:\n\n- **Security Alerts & Events** from the Wazuh Indexer for threat detection and incident response\n- **Agent Management & Monitoring** including health status, system processes, and network ports\n- **Vulnerability Assessment** data for risk management and patch prioritization  \n- **Security Rules & Configuration** for detection optimization and compliance validation\n- **System Statistics & Performance** metrics for operational monitoring and audit trails\n- **Log Analysis & Forensics** capabilities for incident investigation and compliance reporting\n- **Cluster Health & Management** for infrastructure reliability and availability requirements\n- **Compliance Monitoring & Gap Analysis** for regulatory frameworks like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR\n\nRather than requiring manual API calls or complex queries, security teams can now ask natural language questions like \"Show me critical vulnerabilities on web servers,\" \"What processes are running on agent 001?\" or \"Are we meeting PCI-DSS logging requirements?\" and receive structured, actionable data from their Wazuh deployment.\n\nThis approach is particularly valuable for compliance teams who need to quickly assess security posture, identify gaps in monitoring coverage, validate rule effectiveness, and generate evidence for audit requirements across distributed infrastructure.\n\n\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\nThe Wazuh MCP Server provides direct access to Wazuh security data through natural language interactions, enabling several practical use cases:\n\n### Security Alert Analysis\n*   **Alert Triage and Investigation:** Query recent security alerts with `get_wazuh_alert_summary` to quickly identify and prioritize threats requiring immediate attention.\n*   **Alert Pattern Recognition:** Analyze alert trends and patterns to identify recurring security issues or potential attack campaigns.\n\n### Vulnerability Management\n*   **Agent Vulnerability Assessment:** Use `get_wazuh_vulnerability_summary` and `get_wazuh_critical_vulnerabilities` to assess security posture of specific agents and prioritize patching efforts.\n*   **Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization:** Correlate vulnerability data with agent criticality and exposure to focus remediation efforts.\n\n### System Monitoring and Forensics\n*   **Process Analysis:** Investigate running processes on agents using `get_wazuh_agent_processes` for threat hunting and system analysis.\n*   **Network Security Assessment:** Monitor open ports and network services with `get_wazuh_agent_ports` to identify potential attack vectors.\n*   **Agent Health Monitoring:** Track agent status and connectivity using `get_wazuh_running_agents` to ensure comprehensive security coverage.\n\n### Security Operations Intelligence\n*   **Rule Effectiveness Analysis:** Review and analyze security detection rules with `get_wazuh_rules_summary` to optimize detection capabilities.\n*   **Manager Performance Monitoring:** Track system performance and statistics using tools like `get_wazuh_weekly_stats`, `get_wazuh_remoted_stats`, and `get_wazuh_log_collector_stats`.\n*   **Cluster Health Management:** Monitor Wazuh cluster status with `get_wazuh_cluster_health` and `get_wazuh_cluster_nodes` for operational reliability.\n\n### Incident Response and Forensics\n*   **Log Analysis:** Search and analyze manager logs using `search_wazuh_manager_logs` and `get_wazuh_manager_error_logs` for incident investigation.\n*   **Agent-Specific Investigation:** Combine multiple tools to build comprehensive profiles of specific agents during security incidents.\n*   **Natural Language Security Queries:** Ask complex security questions in natural language and receive structured data from multiple Wazuh components.\n\n### Operational Efficiency\n*   **Automated Reporting:** Generate security reports and summaries through conversational interfaces without manual API calls.\n*   **Cross-Component Analysis:** Correlate data from both Wazuh Indexer (alerts) and Wazuh Manager (agents, rules, vulnerabilities) for comprehensive security insights.\n*   **Multilingual Security Operations:** Access Wazuh data and receive insights in multiple languages for global security teams.\n\n### Threat Intelligence Gathering and Response\n\nFor enhanced threat intelligence capabilities, the Wazuh MCP Server can be combined with the **[Cortex MCP Server](https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-cortex/)** to create a powerful security analysis ecosystem.\n\n**Enhanced Capabilities with Cortex Integration:**\n*   **Artifact Analysis:** Automatically analyze suspicious files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses found in Wazuh alerts using Cortex's 140+ analyzers\n*   **IOC Enrichment:** Enrich indicators of compromise (IOCs) from Wazuh alerts with threat intelligence from multiple sources including VirusTotal, Shodan, MISP, and more\n*   **Automated Threat Hunting:** Combine Wazuh's detection capabilities with Cortex's analysis engines to automatically investigate and classify threats\n*   **Multi-Source Intelligence:** Leverage analyzers for reputation checks, malware analysis, domain analysis, and behavioral analysis\n*   **Response Orchestration:** Use analysis results to inform automated response actions and alert prioritization\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n1. Wazuh detects a suspicious file hash or network connection in an alert\n2. The AI assistant automatically queries the Cortex MCP Server to analyze the artifact using multiple analyzers\n3. Results from VirusTotal, hybrid analysis, domain reputation, and other sources are correlated\n4. The combined intelligence provides context for incident response decisions\n5. Findings can be used to update Wazuh rules or trigger additional monitoring\n\n## Requirements\n\n-   An MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatible LLM client (e.g., Claude Desktop)\n-   A running Wazuh server (v4.12 recommended) with the API enabled and accessible.\n-   Network connectivity between this server and the Wazuh API (if API interaction is used).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)\n\n1.  **Download the Binary:**\n    *   Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh/releases) of the `mcp-server-wazuh` GitHub repository.\n    *   Download the appropriate binary for your operating system (e.g., `mcp-server-wazuh-linux-amd64`, `mcp-server-wazuh-macos-amd64`, `mcp-server-wazuh-windows-amd64.exe`).\n    *   Make the downloaded binary executable (e.g., `chmod +x mcp-server-wazuh-linux-amd64`).\n    *   (Optional) Rename it to something simpler like `mcp-server-wazuh` and move it to a directory in your system's `PATH` for easier access.\n\n### Option 2: Docker \n\n1.  **Pull the Docker Image:**\n    ```bash\n    docker pull ghcr.io/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh:latest\n    ```\n\n### Option 3: Build from Source\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:**\n    *   Install Rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n\n2.  **Build:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh.git\n    cd mcp-server-wazuh\n    cargo build --release\n    ```\n    The binary will be available at `target/release/mcp-server-wazuh`.\n\n### Configure Your LLM Client\n\nThe method for configuring your LLM client will vary depending on the client itself. For clients that support MCP (Model Context Protocol), you will typically need to point the client to the path of the `mcp-server-wazuh` executable.\n\n**Example for Claude Desktop:**\n\nConfigure your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"wazuh\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/mcp-server-wazuh\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"WAZUH_API_HOST\": \"your_wazuh_manager_api_host\",\n        \"WAZUH_API_PORT\": \"55000\",\n        \"WAZUH_API_USERNAME\": \"your_wazuh_api_user\",\n        \"WAZUH_API_PASSWORD\": \"your_wazuh_api_password\",\n        \"WAZUH_INDEXER_HOST\": \"your_wazuh_indexer_host\",\n        \"WAZUH_INDEXER_PORT\": \"9200\",\n        \"WAZUH_INDEXER_USERNAME\": \"your_wazuh_indexer_user\",\n        \"WAZUH_INDEXER_PASSWORD\": \"your_wazuh_indexer_password\",\n        \"WAZUH_VERIFY_SSL\": \"false\",\n        \"WAZUH_TEST_PROTOCOL\": \"https\",\n        \"RUST_LOG\": \"info\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/mcp-server-wazuh` with the actual path to your binary and configure the environment variables as detailed in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.\n\nOnce configured, your LLM client should be able to launch and communicate with the `mcp-server-wazuh` to access Wazuh security data.\n\nIf using Docker, create a `.env` file with your Wazuh configuration:\n    \n```bash\nWAZUH_API_HOST=your_wazuh_manager_api_host\nWAZUH_API_PORT=55000\nWAZUH_API_USERNAME=your_wazuh_api_user\nWAZUH_API_PASSWORD=your_wazuh_api_password\nWAZUH_INDEXER_HOST=your_wazuh_indexer_host\nWAZUH_INDEXER_PORT=9200\nWAZUH_INDEXER_USERNAME=your_wazuh_indexer_user\nWAZUH_INDEXER_PASSWORD=your_wazuh_indexer_password\nWAZUH_VERIFY_SSL=false\nWAZUH_TEST_PROTOCOL=https\nRUST_LOG=info\n```\n\nConfigure your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"wazuh\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\", \"--rm\", \"-i\",\n        \"--env-file\", \"/path/to/your/.env\",\n        \"ghcr.io/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh:latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfiguration is managed through environment variables. A `.env` file can be placed in the project root for local development.\n\n| Variable                 | Description                                                                    | Default     | Required |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------- |\n| `WAZUH_API_HOST`         | Hostname or IP address of the Wazuh Manager API server.                        | `localhost` | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_API_PORT`         | Port number for the Wazuh Manager API.                                         | `55000`     | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_API_USERNAME`     | Username for Wazuh Manager API authentication.                                 | `wazuh`     | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_API_PASSWORD`     | Password for Wazuh Manager API authentication.                                 | `wazuh`     | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_INDEXER_HOST`     | Hostname or IP address of the Wazuh Indexer API server.                        | `localhost` | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_INDEXER_PORT`     | Port number for the Wazuh Indexer API.                                         | `9200`      | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_INDEXER_USERNAME` | Username for Wazuh Indexer API authentication.                                 | `admin`     | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_INDEXER_PASSWORD` | Password for Wazuh Indexer API authentication.                                 | `admin`     | Yes      |\n| `WAZUH_VERIFY_SSL`       | Set to `true` to verify SSL certificates for Wazuh API and Indexer connections.  | `false`     | No       |\n| `WAZUH_TEST_PROTOCOL`    | Protocol for Wazuh connections (e.g., \"http\", \"https\").

Setting it to `false` disables certificate checks, which is insecure.\nThe \"Required: Yes\" indicates that these variables are essential for the server to connect to the respective Wazuh components. While defaults are provided, they are unlikely to match a production or non-local setup.\n\n## Building\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   Install Rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n-   Install Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment): [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n### Local Development\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/gbrigandi/mcp-server-wazuh.git \n    cd mcp-server-wazuh\n    ```\n2.  **Configure (if using Wazuh API):**\n    -   Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`\n    -   Edit the `.env` file with your specific Wazuh API details (e.g. `WAZUH_API_HOST`, `WAZUH_API_PORT`).\n3.  **Build:**\n    ```bash\n    cargo build\n    ```\n4.  **Run:**\n    ```bash\n    cargo run\n    # Or use the run script (which might set up stdio mode):\n    # ./run.sh\n    ```\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe server is built using the [rmcp](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp) framework and facilitates communication between MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDE extensions) and the Wazuh MCP Server via stdio transport. The server interacts with the Wazuh Indexer and Wazuh Manager APIs to fetch security alerts and other data.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant ClientApp as Client Application (e.g., IDE Extension / Claude Desktop)\n    participant WazuhMCPServer as Wazuh MCP Server (this application)\n    participant WazuhAPI as Wazuh API\n\n    ClientApp->>+WazuhMCPServer: (stdio) MCP Initialize\n    WazuhMCPServer-->>-ClientApp: (stdout) MCP Initialized\n    \n    ClientApp->>+WazuhMCPServer: (stdio) MCP Request (tools/list)\n    WazuhMCPServer->>WazuhMCPServer: Parse MCP Request\n    WazuhMCPServer->>WazuhMCPServer: Process internally\n    WazuhMCPServer-->>-ClientApp: (stdout) MCP Response (available tools)\n    \n    ClientApp->>+WazuhMCPServer: (stdio) MCP Request (tools/call for wazuhAlerts)\n    WazuhMCPServer->>WazuhMCPServer: Parse MCP Request\n    WazuhMCPServer->>+WazuhAPI: Request Wazuh Alerts (with WAZUH_USER, WAZUH_PASS)\n    WazuhAPI-->>-WazuhMCPServer: Wazuh Alert Data (JSON)\n    WazuhMCPServer->>WazuhMCPServer: Transform Wazuh Alerts to MCP Format\n    WazuhMCPServer-->>-ClientApp: (stdout) MCP Response (alerts)\n```\n\n**Data Flow (stdio focus):**\n\n1.  An application (e.g., an IDE extension, a CLI tool) launches the Wazuh MCP Server as a child process.\n2.  The application sends MCP-formatted requests (commands) to the server's `stdin`.\n3.  The Wazuh MCP Server reads the command from `stdin`.\n4.  **Processing:**\n    *   The server parses the MCP command.\n    *   If the command requires fetching data from Wazuh (e.g., \"get latest alerts\"):\n        *   The server connects to the Wazuh API (authenticating if necessary using configured credentials like `WAZUH_USER`, `WAZUH_PASS`).\n        *   It fetches the required data (e.g., security alerts).\n        *   The server's transformation logic (`src/mcp/transform.rs`) processes each alert, mapping Wazuh fields to MCP fields.\n    *   If the command is internal (e.g., a status check specific to the MCP server), it processes it directly.\n5.  The server sends an MCP-formatted JSON response (e.g., transformed alerts, command acknowledgment, or error messages) to the application via its `stdout`.\n6.  The application reads and processes the MCP response from the server's `stdout`.\n\nThis stdio interaction allows for tight integration with local development tools or other applications that can manage child processes. An optional HTTP endpoint (`/mcp`) may also be available for clients that prefer polling.\n\n\nThe server communicates via `stdin` and `stdout` using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages, adhering to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\nExample interaction flow:\n\n1.  **Client Application (e.g., IDE extension) starts the `mcp-server-wazuh` process.**\n\n2.  **Client sends `initialize` request to server's `stdin`:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n      \"id\": 0,\n      \"method\": \"initialize\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"protocolVersion\": \"2024-11-05\",\n        \"capabilities\": {\n          \"sampling\": {},\n          \"roots\": { \"listChanged\": true }\n        },\n        \"clientInfo\": {\n          \"name\": \"mcp-inspector\",\n          \"version\": \"0.11.0\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Server sends `initialize` response to client via `stdout`:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"result\": {\n        \"protocolVersion\": \"2024-11-05\",\n        \"capabilities\": {\n          \"prompts\": {},\n          \"resources\": {},\n          \"tools\": {}\n        },\n        \"serverInfo\": {\n          \"name\": \"rmcp\",\n          \"version\": \"0.1.5\"\n        },\n        \"instructions\": \"This server provides tools to interact with a Wazuh SIEM instance for security monitoring and analysis.\\nAvailable tools:\\n- 'get_wazuh_alert_summary': Retrieves a summary of Wazuh security alerts.

The outputs are the raw `text` values from the `content` array returned by the server, assuming a client translates the prompts into tool calls.\n\n### Example 1: Fetch Token Approvals\n**Input Prompt**:  \n> \"Show me all the token approvals for my wallet on Polygon.\"\n\n**Output Response**:  \n```\n[\n  {\n    \"tokenAddress\": \"0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174\",\n    \"tokenSymbol\": \"USDC\",\n    \"balance\": \"100.5\",\n    \"usdPrice\": \"1.00\",\n    \"usdValueAtRisk\": \"50.25\",\n    \"spenderAddress\": \"0x1111111254eeb25477b68fb85ed929f73a960582\",\n    \"approvedAmount\": \"1000.0\",\n    \"transactionHash\": \"0xabc...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2023-10-01T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Example 2: Revoke an Allowance\n**Input Prompt**:  \n> \"Revoke the allowance for token 0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174 to spender 0x1111111254eeb25477b68fb85ed929f73a960582 on BSC.\"\n\n**Output Response**:  \n```\nAllowance revocation submitted on bsc. Transaction hash: 0x123.... Note: Transaction is not yet confirmed.\n```\n\n### Example 3: Check Transaction Status\n**Input Prompt**:  \n> \"Did my transaction 0x123... on BSC go through?\"\n\n**Output Response** (possible outputs):  \n- **Pending**:  \n  ```\n  Transaction 0x123... on bsc is still pending or not found.\n  ```\n- **Success**:  \n  ```\n  Transaction 0x123... on bsc has completed with status: successful. Block number: 12345.\n  ```\n- **Failure**:  \n  ```\n  Transaction 0x123... on bsc has completed with status: failed. Block number: 12345.\n  ```\n\n## Supported Chains\n\nThe server supports a wide range of EVM-compatible chains based on the Moralis JS SDK’s `chaindata.ts`. Examples include:\n- Mainnets: `ethereum`, `polygon`, `bsc`, `avalanche`, `fantom`, `arbitrum`, `optimism`, etc.\n- Testnets: `goerli`, `mumbai`, `bsc testnet`, `arbitrum goerli`, `optimism sepolia`, etc.\n- Full list: See `SUPPORTED_CHAINS` in `server.js`.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.

It offers a low code approach for easy implementation and uses AI to mimic the behavior of a high-interaction honeypot.\n\n![github beelzebub - inception program](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e180d602-6de9-4c48-92ad-eb0ef3c5322d)\n## Key Features\n\nBeelzebub offers a wide range of features to enhance your honeypot environment:\n\n- Low-code configuration: YAML-based, modular service definition\n- LLM integration: The LLM convincingly simulates a real system, creating high-interaction honeypot experiences, while actually maintaining low-interaction architecture for enhanced security and easy management.\n- Multi-protocol support: SSH, HTTP, TCP, MCP(Detect prompt injection against LLM agents)\n- Prometheus metrics & observability \n- Docker & Kubernetes ready\n- ELK stack ready, docs: [Official ELK integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/integrations/beelzebub)\n\n## LLM Honeypot Demo\n![demo-beelzebub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dbb9a67-6c12-49c5-82ac-9b3e340406ca)\n\n## Code Quality\n\nWe are strongly committed to maintaining high code quality in the Beelzebub project. Our development workflow includes comprehensive testing, code reviews, static analysis, and continuous integration to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.\n\n### What We Do\n\n* **Automated Testing:**\n  Both unit and integration tests are run on every pull request to catch regressions and ensure stability.\n\n* **Static Analysis:**\n  We use tools like Go Report Card and CodeQL to automatically check for code quality, style, and security issues.\n\n* **Code Coverage:**\n  Our test coverage is monitored with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mariocandela/beelzebub), and we aim for extensive coverage of all core components.\n\n* **Continuous Integration:**\n  Every commit triggers automated CI pipelines on GitHub Actions, which run all tests and quality checks.\n\n* **Code Reviews:**\n  All new contributions undergo peer review to maintain consistency and high standards across the project.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nYou can run Beelzebub via Docker, Go compiler(cross device), or Helm (Kubernetes).\n\n### Using Docker Compose\n\n1. Build the Docker images:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ docker-compose build\n   ```\n\n2. Start Beelzebub in detached mode:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ docker-compose up -d\n   ```\n\n\n### Using Go Compiler\n\n1. Download the necessary Go modules:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ go mod download\n   ```\n\n2. Build the Beelzebub executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ go build\n   ```\n\n3. Run Beelzebub:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ ./beelzebub\n   ```\n\n### Deploy on kubernetes cluster using helm\n\n1. Install helm\n\n2. Deploy beelzebub:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ helm install beelzebub ./beelzebub-chart\n   ```\n\n3. Next release\n\n   ```bash\n   $ helm upgrade beelzebub ./beelzebub-chart\n   ```\n\n## Example Configuration\n\nBeelzebub allows easy configuration for different services and ports. Simply create a new file for each service/port within the `/configurations/services` directory.\n\nTo execute Beelzebub with your custom path, use the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ ./beelzebub --confCore ./configurations/beelzebub.yaml --confServices ./configurations/services/\n```\n\nHere are some example configurations for different honeypot scenarios:\n\n### MCP Honeypot\n\n#### Why choose an MCP Honeypot?\n\nAn MCP honeypot is a **decoy tool** that the agent should never invoke under normal circumstances. Integrating this strategy into your agent pipeline offers three key benefits:\n\n* **Real-time detection of guardrail bypass attempts.**\n  \n  Instantly identify when a prompt injection attack successfully convinces the agent to invoke a restricted tool.\n* **Automatic collection of real attack prompts for guardrail fine-tuning.**\n  \n   Every activation logs genuine malicious prompts, enabling continuous improvement of your filtering mechanisms.\n* **Continuous monitoring of attack trends through key metrics (HAR, TPR, MTP).**\n  \n   Track exploit frequency and system resilience using objective, actionable measurements.\n\n![video-mcp-diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e04fd19e-9537-427e-9131-9bee31d8ebad)\n\n##### Example MCP Honeypot Configuration\n\n###### mcp-8000.yaml\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: \"v1\"\nprotocol: \"mcp\"\naddress: \":8000\"\ndescription: \"MCP Honeypot\"\ntools:\n  - name: \"tool:user-account-manager\"\n    description: \"Tool for querying and modifying user account details.

The MCP server will then be able to call protected APIs on behalf of the user.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Todos API\n\nBefore you can use the MCP server, you will need to deploy the Todos API as documented [here](../todos-api/README.md).\n\n### Auth0 Configuration\n\nIn the Auth0 dashboard, create a new application in the Applications section (type: \"Regular Web Application\").\n\n\n\nOnce the application is created, configure the following URL as the callback URL when developing locally:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8788/callback\n```\n\n### Set up a KV namespace\n\n- Create the KV namespace:\n  `wrangler kv:namespace create \"OAUTH_KV\"`\n- Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThis MCP Server needs a few environment variables to be configured:\n\n| Setting               | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `AUTH0_DOMAIN`        | The domain of your Auth0 tenant (e.g., `acme.auth0.com`)                                                                                                                        |\n| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`     | The Client ID from the Auth0 application you created                                                                                                                            |\n| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | The Client Secret from the Auth0 application you created                                                                                                                        |\n| `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`      | The unique identifier for your API which you registered in the Auth0 dashbaord (e.g., `urn:todos-api`)                                                                          |\n| `AUTH0_SCOPE`         | The scopes requested by the MCP Server. Here we request basic profile info (`openid email profile`), refresh token capability (`offline_access`), and API access (`read:todos`) |\n| `NODE_ENV`            | The environment setting - use `development` for local development                                                                                                               |\n| `API_BASE_URL`        | The base URL where your Todos API is running                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Development\n\nCreate a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project with the following structure:\n\n```\nAUTH0_DOMAIN=yourdomain.us.auth0.com\nAUTH0_CLIENT_ID=The Client ID of the application you created in Auth0\nAUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=The Client Secret of the application you created in Auth0\nAUTH0_AUDIENCE=urn:todos-api\nAUTH0_SCOPE=openid email profile offline_access read:todos\nNODE_ENV=development\nAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8789\n```\n\n### Testing the MCP Server\n\nTo start the MCP server, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nWith MCP Inspector you can connect to the MCP server, list the available tools and call them. Make sure to set the transport type to `sse` and the URL to `http://localhost:8788/sse`.\n\n\n\n## Deploying the MCP Server to Cloudflare\n\nTo deploy the MCP Server to Cloudflare, you will first need to set the following secrets:\n\n```bash\nwrangler secret put AUTH0_DOMAIN\nwrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_ID\nwrangler secret put AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET\nwrangler secret put AUTH0_AUDIENCE\nwrangler secret put AUTH0_SCOPE\nwrangler secret put API_BASE_URL\n```\n\nOnce the secrets are set, you can deploy the API with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\nIn the Auth0 dashboard, also make sure to add a new Callback URL for your deployed MCP server, eg:\n\n```bash\nhttps://mcp-auth0-oidc.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback\n```\n\nTo test this you can now use the Workers AI LLM Playground. Navigate to [https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/) and connect to your MCP server on the bottom left using the following URL pattern:\n\n```bash\nhttps://mcp-auth0-oidc.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse\n```\n\nThis will open a popup where you can sign in after which you'll be able to use all of the tools.\n\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues while setting up or using the MCP server, here are some troubleshooting steps:\n\n**Check Worker Logs**\n\nVisit the [Cloudflare Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/) in your dashboard\n\n**Auth0 Dashboard Logs**\n\n- Navigate to the Logs section in your Auth0 Dashboard\n- Review authentication attempts and failures\n\n\n\n**Common Issues**\n\n- If authentication fails, verify your Auth0 configuration and secrets\n- For connection issues, ensure your Worker is deployed and the domain is correct\n- Check that all callback URLs are properly configured in Auth0\n- Verify the API_BASE_URL matches your deployed API endpoint",

API Key Management\n   - Store API keys in environment variables\n   - Rotate keys regularly\n   - Use different keys per environment\n\n2. Access Control\n   - Implement rate limiting\n   - Configure IP allowlists\n   - Use principle of least privilege\n\n3. Monitoring\n   - Enable audit logging\n   - Monitor auth failures\n   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Better Auth MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@nahmanmate/better-auth-mcp-server):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @nahmanmate/better-auth-mcp-server --client claude\n```\n\nTo use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"better-auth-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/better-auth-mcp-server/build/index.js\"],\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"alwaysAllow\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:\n\n```bash\nnpm run inspector\n```\n\nThe Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Project Setup\n```typescript\n// Initialize Better-Auth in your project\nawait mcp.useTool('setup_better_auth', {\n  projectPath: './my-next-app',\n  config: {\n    projectId: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_PROJECT_ID,\n    apiKey: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_API_KEY\n  }\n});\n\n// Test core authentication flows\nawait mcp.useTool('test_auth_flows', {\n  flows: ['login', 'register', '2fa']\n});\n```\n\n### Migration from Auth.js/NextAuth\n```typescript\n// Analyze current auth implementation\nawait mcp.useTool('analyze_current_auth', {\n  projectPath: './my-next-app'\n});\n\n// Generate migration steps\nawait mcp.useTool('generate_migration_plan', {\n  projectPath: './my-next-app',\n  currentAuthType: 'next-auth'\n});\n\n```\n",

      "readme_content": "# mcp-censys\n\n> mcp-censys is a MCP server that taps into the Censys Search API for real-time domain, IP, and FQDN reconnaissance, now with enhanced **MCP Prompt Templates**.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This is intended solely as a demonstration and is not production-ready. It is not an officially supported product.\n\n## Overview\n\nmcp-censys turns natural language prompts into targeted Censys queries — surfacing host, DNS, cert, and service information in real-time. It's designed to work with Claude Desktop or any other Model Context Protocol (MCP) client.\n\nBuilt on the official Censys Python SDK, this lightweight container exposes precise reconnaissance tools through Claude-friendly functions.\n\n> [!NEW] **MCP Prompt Templates**\n> \n> This version introduces **MCP Prompt Templates** - predefined instruction sets that guide Claude's analysis of domain data. These templates provide structured guidance on how to organize and present the findings, ensuring consistent, high-quality outputs. [Learn more about MCP Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Conversational Queries**: Natural language access to Censys intel\n- **Domain and IP Lookup**: Get DNS names, ASN, services, and TLS context\n- **New FQDN Discovery**: Find recently seen subdomains from DNS and cert data\n- **MCP-Compatible Tools**: Use directly from Claude Desktop\n- **MCP Prompt Templates**: ✨ Built-in structured guidance templates that instruct Claude exactly how to analyze and present domain data ([learn more about MCP Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts))\n- **Dockerized with .env support**: Secure, repeatable usage\n- **Lightweight API Client**: Based on Censys Python SDK\n\n## Tools\n\n- **lookup_domain** - Get comprehensive IPs, DNS names, services, and ASN info for a domain (aggregates data across all results) with **built-in MCP prompts** that guide Claude to organize findings into meaningful sections\n- **lookup_domain_detailed** - Return a sample of 3 individual host records with services, ASN, geo, and TLS data, along with information about total available records and **structured MCP prompts** for comprehensive infrastructure analysis\n- **lookup_ip** - Enrich an IP with DNS, ASN, service info, and TLS metadata\n- **new_fqdns** - Find recently observed FQDNs for a domain (via DNS and certs)\n- **host_services** - List open ports and service banners for a given domain or IP\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n### 1. Domain Lookup (`lookup_domain`)\n\nReturns complete information by aggregating all IPs, DNS names, service banners, and ASN info tied to a specific domain. Useful for understanding what infrastructure a domain resolves to.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nUser: What's behind mailchimp.com?\n\nAI: mailchimp.com resolves to multiple IPs operated by The Rocket Science Group (AS2635). The domain exposes ports 80 and 443 with HTTP services, and reverse DNS shows aliases like smtp.mailchimp.com and us1.admin.mailchimp.com. Several servers respond with the banner 'mailchimp-nginx'.\n```\n\n### 2. Detailed Domain Lookup (`lookup_domain_detailed`)\n\nProvides a sample of actual host records (limited to 3) matching a domain query, plus information about how many total records exist.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nUser: Show me detailed records for mailchimp.com\n\nAI: I found 42 host records for mailchimp.com. Here's a sample of 3:\n\nIP: 205.201.131.98 - Located in Atlanta, GA (The Rocket Science Group)\nServices: HTTP/80, HTTPS/443, SMTP/25\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04\nIP: 205.201.132.24 - Located in Atlanta, GA (The Rocket Science Group)\nServices: HTTP/80, HTTPS/443\nTLS: TLSv1.2, RSA 2048-bit\nIP: 198.2.131.20 - Located in Atlanta, GA (The Rocket Science Group)\nServices: SMTP/25, SMTP/587\nTLS: TLSv1.2, DH 2048-bit\nThere are 39 additional records not displayed.\n```\n\n### 3. IP Lookup (`lookup_ip`)\n\nProvides full context for an IP including DNS names, ASN, TLS certs, services, and location data.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nUser: Tell me about 184.29.22.16\n\nAI: 184.29.22.16 is associated with Akamai (AS20940). It has two services exposed: HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on 443. It's hosted in the United States and uses a TLS certificate issued by Let's Encrypt.\n```\n\n### 4. New FQDN Discovery (`new_fqdns`)\n\nFind recently observed FQDNs for a domain from both DNS records and certificate transparency logs.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nUser: What new fqdns has microsoft.com had in the last 3 days?\nAI: In the last 3 days, 17 FQDNs were observed for microsoft.com, including:\n\nlogin.microsoft.com (seen in DNS and certs)\napi.microsoft.com (seen in certs only)\ngraph.microsoft.com (seen in DNS only)\nteams.microsoft.com (seen in DNS and certs)\n```\n\n### 5. Host Services (`host_services`)\n\nQuickly identifies what ports are open on a given IP and what services are running.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nUser: What ports are open on example.com?\n\nAI: example.com (93.184.216.34) has the following services:\n\nHTTP on port 80 (last seen 2 hours ago)\nHTTPS on port 443 (last seen 2 hours ago)\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-censys.git\ncd mcp-censys\n\n# Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t mcp/censys .\n\n# .env should contain:\nCENSYS_API_ID=your_censys_api_id\nCENSYS_API_SECRET=your_censys_api_secret\n```\n\n## MCP Configuration\n\nAdd this to your Claude Desktop config:\n\n```json\n\"censys\": {\n  \"command\": \"docker\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--env-file\", \"/Users/yourname/.env.censys\",\n    \"mcp/censys\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n## Screenshot\n\nmcp-censys in action via Claude Desktop, using the `lookup_domain`, `lookup_domain_detailed` and `lookup_ip` tools:\n\n\n\n> This example shows a domain lookup request on `mailchimp.com`, returning IPs, ASN, subdomains, services and infrastructure — all from a natural language query.\n\n\n\n> This example shows a detailed domain lookup request on `mailchimp.com`, returning IPs, ASN, subdomains, BGP, TLS, information, services and infrastructure.\n\n\n\n> This example demonstrates an IP lookup on `23.204.1.14`, returning coordinates, forward and reverse DNS and services.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n**No Results Returned**:\n\n- Make sure the target is publicly visible\n- Check your API key and rate limits\n- DNS-based results rely on recent Censys observations\n\n**Performance Tips**:\n\n- Scan a single domain or IP at a time for faster results\n- Use lookup_domain or lookup_ip for focused data\n\n**API Response Issues**:\n\n- If you experience errors with result formatting, ensure you're using the latest version\n- The tools handle pagination automatically - lookup_domain collects all available results, while lookup_domain_detailed shows a limited sample\n- For domains with many results, queries may take longer to complete due to multiple API requests\n\n## Limitations\n\n- new_fqdns does not represent true \"first seen\" FQDNs; it filters by last observed timestamps\n- This tool is intended for conversational, single-target analysis (not batch scans)\n- lookup_domain_detailed only shows 3 records to keep responses manageable, even when more are available\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- Censys Python SDK (https://github.com/censys/censys-python)\n- Model Context Protocol (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- Claude Desktop (https://www.anthropic.com)",

      "readme_content": "# mcp-recon\n\n> **mcp-recon** (formerly Tellix) is a conversational reconnaissance interface and MCP server powered by `httpx` and `asnmap`. Just ask.\n\n## Overview\n\n**mcp-recon** bridges the gap between natural language and HTTP infrastructure analysis. It exposes reconnaissance tools through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), allowing you to perform web domain reconnaissance via any compatible AI interface, such as Claude Desktop.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Conversational Commands**: Execute reconnaissance through simple text prompts\n- **MCP Server**: Integrates with Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible tools\n- **Multiple Analysis Modes**: Choose from lite and full reconnaissance levels\n- **Standalone ASN Lookup**: Query IPs, ASNs, or organizations directly\n- **Docker Ready**: Run in an isolated container for security and portability\n- **Powered by `httpx`**: Utilizes ProjectDiscovery's robust reconnaissance tools\n- **Bug Workarounds**: Automatically handles `httpx`'s stdin/stdout leakage issue\n- **MCP Prompts**: Includes predefined prompts like `http_lite_scan` and `katana_command_generator` for streamlined operations\n\n## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools, systems, and data sources. MCP provides a standardized interface for AI models to access and execute functions, retrieve resources, and utilize prompts, facilitating seamless integration between AI applications and various software environments.\n\n## MCP Prompts in mcp-recon\n\nIn MCP, a **prompt** is a predefined template that guides AI assistants in performing specific tasks. Prompts can accept dynamic arguments, include context from resources, and chain multiple interactions, enabling structured and efficient workflows.\n\n**mcp-recon** includes the following prompts:\n\n- **`http_lite_scan`**: Initiates a quick HTTP scan for basic information about specified targets.\n- **`katana_command_generator`**: Generates optimized Katana crawl commands based on reconnaissance goals and desired thoroughness.\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n**mcp-recon** provides three main reconnaissance tools:\n\n### 1. Quick/Lightweight Reconnaissance (`http_lite_recon`)\n\nFast, lightweight HTTP fingerprinting that provides essential information with minimal overhead.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nUser: \"Using quick http recon, what's the status code for example.com?\"\n\nAI: \"I checked example.com and it's currently returning a 200 OK status code, indicating the site is up and functioning normally. It's being served from an Nginx web server on IP 93.184.216.34.\"\n```\n\n### 2. Full Reconnaissance (`http_full_recon`)\n\nComprehensive metadata collection including page previews, headers, certificates, and technology detection.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nUser: \"Using full http recon, what certificates is www.google.com using?\"\n\nAI: \"Based on my analysis, www.google.com is using a TLS 1.3 certificate issued by Google Trust Services. The certificate was issued on March 20, 2025, and is valid until June 12, 2025. It was specifically issued for 'www.google.com' and uses the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite.\"\n```\n\n### 3. ASN Lookup (`asn_lookup`)\n\nStandalone lookup of IPs, ASNs, or organization names using ProjectDiscovery's `asnmap` library.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nUser: \"Who owns ASN 14421?\"\n\nAI: \"ASN 14421 is operated by 'PPLINKNET' in the US.\"\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/nickpending/mcp-recon.git\ncd mcp-recon\n\n# Build the Docker image\ndocker build -t mcp/recon -f Dockerfile .\n```\n\n**mcp-recon** is designed to run as a Docker container to be used with Claude Desktop via the MCP protocol.\n\n## MCP Configuration\n\n**mcp-recon** runs as a standalone MCP server. Add it to your MCP configuration like so:\n\n```json\n\"mcp-recon\": {\n  \"command\": \"docker\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"mcp/recon\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nUsing an `.env` file:\n\n```json\n\"mcp-recon\": {\n  \"command\": \"docker\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--env-file\", \"/Users/yourname/.config/mcp-recon.env\",\n    \"mcp/recon\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYour `.env` should contain:\n\n```env\nPDCP_API_KEY=your_projectdiscovery_api_key\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**No Results Returned**:\n- Domain is publicly accessible\n- You've specified the correct tool (`http_lite_recon`, `http_full_recon`, `asn_lookup`)\n- Target domain isn't blocking scans\n\n**Performance Issues**:\n- Start with `http_lite_recon` for faster results\n- Scan fewer domains at once for better performance\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- **httpx Stdin Leak**: The `httpx` library attempts to read stdin even when used as a library. `mcp-recon` shields `os.Stdin` to prevent interference with MCP.\n- **ASN Silent Failures**: Even when `Asn = true`, `httpx` may fail to enrich IPs. `mcp-recon` includes a fallback using the official `asnmap` Go library.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Only scan domains you own or have permission to test\n- The full_recon mode retrieves complete page content — use judiciously\n- Consider rate limiting to avoid impacting target systems\n\n## Screenshots\n\n\n> This example shows a quick recon request on `www.google.com`, returning status code, title, server details, and IP address — all from a natural language query.\n\n\n> This example demonstrates a complete recon on `www.microsoft.com`, including TLS config, headers, CDN, and security observations.\n\n## Name Change Notice\n\nThis project was formerly known as **Tellix**. It has been renamed to **mcp-recon** to better align with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) naming convention used in security tools. All links to the previous repository name will be redirected to the new name, but you should update your references when possible.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.

Use at your own risk.\n\n## Features\n\n- 🔍 **Project Scanning**: Automatically scan your project directory for security vulnerabilities using Trivy\n- 🛠️ **Automated Fixes**: Automatically update vulnerable dependencies to secure versions\n- 📦 **Multi-Package Support**: Handles multiple package managers (Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go)\n\n# Demo\n\n\n\n## Architecture\n\n```plaintext\n┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐\n│  Cursor IDE │ --> │   MCP Server │ --> │    Trivy    │\n│  (Composer) │     │              │     │             │\n└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.12 or higher\n- Trivy installed on your system:\n  ```bash\n  # macOS\n  brew install trivy\n  ```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Create and activate virtual environment\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nStart the server using SSE transport:\n\n```bash\n# Using SSE transport (default)\npython server.py --transport sse --port 54321\n```\n\nThe server exposes two tools:\n\n1. `scan_project`: Scans a directory for security vulnerabilities\n   - Required argument: `workspace` - The directory path to scan\n\n2. `fix_vulnerability`: Updates a vulnerable package to a secure version\n   - Required arguments:\n     - `workspace` - The directory to modify\n     - `pkg_name` - Name of the package to update\n     - `target_version` - Version to update to\n\n## Using with Cursor IDE\n\n1. Start the server with SSE transport:\n   ```bash\n   python server.py --transport sse --port 54321\n   ```\n\n2. Configure in Cursor:\n   - Open Settings\n   - Go to Features > MCP Servers\n   - Add: `http://127.0.0.1:54321/sse`\n\n3. Add the following to your .cursorrules file, create it if you don't have one yet:\n   ```\n   After making changes in any of the package dependency/manifest files, scan the project for security vulnerabilities.\n   Fixes should only be according to the desired version reported by the scanner.\n   If the scanner reports a fix unrelated to our change, ignore it.\n   After performing the fix, scan the project for security vulnerabilities again.\n   ```\n\n    This configuration will:\n    - Automatically trigger a security scan when any dependency file is modified\n    - Help identify vulnerabilities as soon as new dependencies are added\n    - Ensure your project stays secure throughout development\n   \n   if you want to use the tool manually, you can use prompt the agent to use the tool with the following prompt through the composer interface:\n   ```\n   Please scan my project for security vulnerabilities\n   ```\n\n## Why MCP?\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) exists to solve a fundamental problem in working with large language models (LLMs): how to efficiently and consistently connect these models to external data sources and tools.\n\nLearn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Create an API token in Panther:\n   - Navigate to Settings (gear icon) → API Tokens\n   - Create a new token with the following permissions (recommended read-only approach to start):\n   - <details>\n     <summary><strong>View Required Permissions</strong></summary>\n\n     \n     \n\n     </details>\n\n2. Store the generated token securely (e.g., 1Password)\n\n3. Copy the Panther instance URL from your browser (e.g., `https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain`)\n    - Note: This must include `https://`\n\n## MCP Server Installation\n\n**Choose one of the following installation methods:**\n\n### Docker (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to get started is using our pre-built Docker image:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-panther\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"-e\", \"PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL\",\n        \"-e\", \"PANTHER_API_TOKEN\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL\": \"https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain\",\n        \"PANTHER_API_TOKEN\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### UVX\n\nFor Python users, you can run directly from PyPI using uvx:\n\n1. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n2. Configure your MCP client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-panther\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-panther\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL\": \"https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain\",\n        \"PANTHER_API_TOKEN\": \"YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP Client Setup\n\n### Cursor\n\n[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) to configure your project or global MCP configuration. **It's VERY IMPORTANT that you do not check this file into version control.**\n\nOnce configured, navigate to Cursor Settings > MCP to view the running server:\n\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Be specific about where you want to generate new rules by using the `@` symbol and then typing a specific directory.\n- For more reliability during tool use, try selecting a specific model, like Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n- If your MCP Client is failing to find any tools from the Panther MCP Server, try restarting the Client and ensuring the MCP server is running. In Cursor, refresh the MCP Server and start a new chat.\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\nTo use with Claude Desktop, manually configure your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n1. Open the Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the Developer tab\n2. Click \"Edit Config\" to open the configuration file\n3. Add the following configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-panther\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-panther\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL\": \"https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain\",\n        \"PANTHER_API_TOKEN\": \"YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop\n\nIf you run into any issues, [try the troubleshooting steps here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#troubleshooting).\n\n### Goose CLI\n\nUse with [Goose CLI](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation/), Block's open-source AI agent:\n\n```bash\n# Start Goose with the MCP server\ngoose session --with-extension \"uvx mcp-panther\"\n```\n\n### Goose Desktop\n\nUse with [Goose Desktop](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/installation/), Block's open-source AI agent:\n\nFrom 'Extensions' -> 'Add custom extension' provide your configuration information.\n\n\n\n## Running the Server\n\nThe MCP Panther server supports multiple transport protocols:\n\n### STDIO (Default)\n\nFor local development and MCP client integration:\n\n```bash\nuv run python -m mcp_panther.server\n```\n\n### Streamable HTTP\n\nFor running as a persistent web service:\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n  -e PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL=https://instance.domain/ \\\n  -e PANTHER_API_TOKEN= \\\n  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \\\n  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \\\n  -e MCP_PORT=8000 \\\n  --rm -i -p 8000:8000 \\\n  ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther\n```\n\nYou can then connect to the server at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.\n\nTo test the connection using FastMCP client:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom fastmcp import Client\n\nasync def test_connection():\n    async with Client(\"http://localhost:8000/mcp\") as client:\n        tools = await client.list_tools()\n        print(f\"Available tools: {len(tools)}\")\n\nasyncio.run(test_connection())\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n- `MCP_TRANSPORT`: Set transport type (`stdio` or `streamable-http`)\n- `MCP_PORT`: Port for HTTP transport (default: 3000)\n- `MCP_HOST`: Host for HTTP transport (default: 127.0.0.1)\n- `MCP_LOG_FILE`: Log file path (optional)\n\n## Security Best Practices\n\nWe highly recommends the following MCP security best practices:\n\n- **Apply strict least-privilege to Panther API tokens.** Scope tokens to the minimal permissions required and bind them to an IP allow-list or CIDR range so they're useless if exfiltrated. Rotate credentials on a preferred interval (e.g., every 30d).\n- **Host the MCP server in a locked-down sandbox (e.g., Docker) with read-only mounts.** This confines any compromise to a minimal blast radius.\n- **Monitor credential access to Panther and monitor for anomalies.** Write a Panther rule!\n- **Run only trusted, officially signed MCP servers.** Verify digital signatures or checksums before running, audit the tool code, and avoid community tools from unofficial publishers.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCheck the server logs for detailed error messages: `tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`. Common issues and solutions are listed below.\n\n### Running tools\n\n- If you get a `{\"success\": false, \"message\": \"Failed to [action]: Request failed (HTTP 403): {\\\"error\\\": \\\"forbidden\\\"}\"}` error, it likely means your API token lacks the particular permission needed by the tool.\n- Ensure your Panther Instance URL is correctly set. You can view this in the `config://panther` resource from your MCP Client.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to improve MCP-Panther!

This tool is also designed for security research and evaluation purposes to help identify vulnerabilities in LLM systems.\n\n`~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~`\n\n## 📖 Introduction\n\nThe C̷h̷u̷c̷k̷N̷o̷r̷r̷i̷s̷ MCP Server provides an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that delivers specialized enhancement prompts to various LLMs. It uses jailbreak prompts from [elder-plinius' L1B3RT4S](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S) project and implements a dynamic schema approach for more effective delivery.\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\nRun directly with `npx`:\n\n```bash\nnpx @pollinations/chucknorris\n```\n\n### MCP Client Configuration\n\nAdd to your MCP server list in `mcp_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chucknorris\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@pollinations/chucknorris\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~`\n\n## 🤔 How It Works\n\n### Advanced Dynamic Approach\n\nThe server uses a two-phase approach to bypass jailbreak detection:\n\n1. **First Call**: \n   - AI Assistant discovers the `C̷h̷u̷c̷k̷N̷o̷r̷r̷i̷s̷` tool with a neutral schema description\n   - Assistant calls the tool with its model type\n   - Server returns a subtle \"preparation\" prompt that makes the LLM receptive to the jailbreak\n   - Server remembers the LLM type for the next call\n\n2. **Subsequent Calls**:\n   - Schema dynamically changes to include the jailbreak in its description\n   - Tool description now contains model-specific jailbreak instructions\n   - Server continues to return the same preparation prompt\n   - Only the schema changes between calls, not the response content\n\nThis approach combines [elder-plinius' L1B3RT4S](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S) jailbreak prompts with a dynamic schema modification technique, making it more effective at bypassing detection as it doesn't immediately present the jailbreak content.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[AI Assistant] -- First Call --> B(Neutral Schema);\n    B -- Returns Preparation Prompt --> A;\n    A -- Subsequent Call --> C(Enhanced Schema with Jailbreak);\n    C -- Returns Same Preparation Prompt --> A;\n```\n\n### Security Research Purpose\n\nThis tool implements the technique described in \"The 'S' in MCP Stands for Security\" research, demonstrating how MCP tools can:\n\n1. Present different information to users vs. AI models\n2. Change their behavior after initial approval\n3. Use multi-phase approaches to potentially bypass security measures\n\nThe implementation uses jailbreak prompts from [elder-plinius' L1B3RT4S](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S) project, combined with a dynamic schema modification technique similar to the [Tool Poisoning Attack research by Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) and their [MCP injection experiments](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-injection-experiments).\n\nBy understanding these techniques, developers can build more robust and secure AI systems.\n\n`~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~`\n\n## 🙏 Credits\n\nBased on [L1B3RT4S](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S) by [elder-plinius](https://github.com/elder-plinius).\n\n`~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~`\n\n## 🚧 Status\n\nExperimental. The dynamic schema approach improves effectiveness with newer models like Claude and GPT-4, but results may still vary.\n\nWant to help?

You end up running this untested code directly on your machine, which could have drastic unintended consequences.\n\nGiving LLMs the tools to test the code safely prevents such issues and helps you **generate more accurate code in fewer iterations**.\n\nSandbox MCP gives the LLMs an **easy-to-use execution environment that anyone can create and configure** through a simple, AI-native MCP server that runs locally.\n\n_Inspired by [Codapi](https://codapi.org). Some sandboxes are the same as [Codapi sandboxes](https://github.com/nalgeon/sandboxes)._\n\n## Use Cases\n\nSandbox MCP can be used for many different tasks, including but not limited to:\n\n- **Secure code execution**: Run any code generated by an LLM in a secure, isolated environment, protecting your system from untrusted or potentially harmful code.\n- **Code testing**: Automatically test and validate code in various languages and or configurations in various environments before integrating it into larger projects or production systems.\n- **User code validation**: Safely execute and check user-submitted code or scripts, ensuring they behave as expected and do not perform malicious actions.\n- **Network troubleshooting**: Diagnose connectivity issues, test endpoints, and analyze network performance using isolated network tools, all without exposing your system.\n- **Educational and interview coding**: Instantly compile and run code snippets for learning, teaching, or technical interviews, providing immediate feedback in a safe, temporary environment.\n- **Automated code review and feedback**: Enable LLMs to execute, test, and review code automatically, offering actionable feedback or suggestions before code is merged or deployed.\n\n## Demo\n\nThis demo shows how Sandbox MCP works with Claude Desktop.\n\n\n\nTry the [video](demo.mp4) if the GIF isn't clear.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Download Binary\n\nYou can download the appropriate binary for your operating system (for example, `Darwin`) and processor architecture (`arm64`) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/releases) (`sandbox-mcp_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`).\n\n### Install via Go\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n- Go 1.24 or higher\n\n```bash\ngo install github.com/pottekkat/sandbox-mcp/cmd/sandbox-mcp@latest\n```\n\nGet the path to the `sandbox-mcp` binary:\n\n```bash\nwhich sandbox-mcp\n```\n\n### Build from Source\n\nSee the [Development section](#development).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initilization\n\nBefore you use `sandbox-mcp` with LLMs, you need to initialize its configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Create the configuration directory in\n# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sandbox-mcp and pull\n# the default sandboxes from GitHub\nsandbox-mcp --pull\n\n# Build the Docker images for the sandboxes\nsandbox-mcp --build\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Make sure you have Docker installed and running.\n\n### With MCP Hosts/Clients\n\nAdd this to your `claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop or `mcp.json` for Cursor IDE:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"sandbox-mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"path/to/sandbox-mcp\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--stdio\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Make sure to replace `path/to/sandbox-mcp` with the actual path to the `sandbox-mcp` binary.\n\n## Available Sandboxes\n\n| Sandbox | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| [shell](/sandboxes/shell) | A secure, isolated Linux environment for running lightweight commands that does not require network access. |\n| [python](/sandboxes/python) | Safely execute Python code in a secure, isolated environment. |\n| [rust](/sandboxes/rust) | Compile and run Rust code in an isolated environment. |\n| [network-tools](/sandboxes/network-tools) | Use various network utilities in an isolated Linux sandbox.

      "readme_content": "# Snyk MCP Server\n\nA standalone Model Context Protocol server for Snyk security scanning functionality.\n\n**WARNING: THIS MCP SERVER IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA AND IS NOT YET FINISHED!**\n\n## Configuration\n\nUpdate your Claude desktop config (`claude-config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"snyk\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"github:sammcj/mcp-snyk\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SNYK_API_KEY\": \"your_snyk_token\",\n        \"SNYK_ORG_ID\": \"your_default_org_id\"  // Optional: Configure a default organisation ID\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace the token with your actual Snyk API token. The organisation ID can be configured in multiple ways:\n\n1. In the MCP settings via `SNYK_ORG_ID` (as shown above)\n2. Using the Snyk CLI: `snyk config set org=your-org-id`\n3. Providing it directly in commands\n\nThe server will try these methods in order until it finds a valid organisation ID.\n\n### Verifying Configuration\n\nYou can verify your Snyk token is configured correctly by asking Claude to run the verify_token command:\n\n```\nVerify my Snyk token configuration\n```\n\nThis will check if your token is valid and show your Snyk user information. If you have the Snyk CLI installed and configured, it will also show your CLI-configured organization ID.\n\n## Features\n\n- Repository security scanning using GitHub/GitLab URLs\n- Snyk project scanning\n- Integration with Claude desktop\n- Token verification\n- Multiple organization ID configuration options\n- Snyk CLI integration for organization ID lookup\n\n## Usage\n\nTo scan a repository, you must provide its GitHub or GitLab URL:\n\n```\nScan repository https://github.com/owner/repo for security vulnerabilities\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The scan_repository command requires the actual repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/owner/repo). Do not use local file paths - always use the repository's URL on GitHub or GitLab.\n\nFor Snyk projects:\n\n```\nScan Snyk project project-id-here\n```\n\n### Organization ID Configuration\n\nThe server will look for the organization ID in this order:\n\n1. Command argument (if provided)\n2. MCP settings environment variable (`SNYK_ORG_ID`)\n3. Snyk CLI configuration (`snyk config get org`)\n\nYou only need to specify the organization ID in your command if you want to override the configured values:\n\n```\nScan repository https://github.com/owner/repo in organisation org-id-here\n```\n\n### Snyk CLI Integration\n\nIf you have the Snyk CLI installed (`npm install -g snyk`), the server can use it to:\n\n- Get your default organisation ID\n- Fall back to CLI configuration when MCP settings are not provided\n- Show CLI configuration details in token verification output\n\nThis integration makes it easier to use the same organisation ID across both CLI and MCP server usage.\n",

Semgrep [supports 30+ languages](#language-support) and can run in an IDE, as a pre-commit check, and as part of CI/CD workflows.\n\nSemgrep is semantic grep for code. While running `grep \"2\"` would only match the exact string _2_, Semgrep would [match `x = 1; y = x + 1` when searching for _2_](https://semgrep.dev/playground/s/5rKgj). Semgrep rules look like the code you already write; no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs.\n\nNote that in security contexts, Semgrep Community Edition will miss many true positives as it can only analyze code within the boundaries of a single function or file. If you want to use Semgrep for security purposes (**SAST**, **SCA**, or **secrets scanning**), the Semgrep AppSec Platform is strongly recommended since it adds the following critical capabilities:\n\n1. Improved core analysis capabilities (cross-file, cross-function, data-flow reachability) that greatly reduce false positives by 25% and increase detected true positives by 250%\n2. Contextual post-processing of findings with Semgrep Assistant (AI) to further reduce noise by [~20%](https://a.storyblok.com/f/151984/x/2d12dc0223/whitepaper_-ai-powered-appsec-engineer-automate.pdf?cv=1728584410408).  In addition, Assistant enriches findings with tailored, step-by-step remediation guidance that humans find actionable >80% of the time.\n3. Customizable policies and seamless integration into developer workflows, giving security teams granular control over where, when, and how different findings are presented to developers (IDE, PR comment, etc.)\n\nThe Semgrep AppSec Platform works out-of-the-box with 20000+ proprietary rules across SAST, SCA, and secrets. Pro rules are written and maintained by the Semgrep security research team and are highly accurate, meaning AppSec teams can feel confident bringing findings directly to developers without slowing them down.\n\nSemgrep analyzes code locally on your computer or in your build environment: **by default, code is never uploaded**.

[From the CLI](#option-2-getting-started-from-the-cli)\n\nFor new users, we recommend starting with the [Semgrep AppSec Platform](#option-1-getting-started-from-the-semgrep-appsec-platform-recommended) because it provides a visual interface, a demo project, result triaging and exploration workflows, and makes setup in CI/CD fast. Scans are still local and code isn't uploaded. Alternatively, you can also start with the CLI and navigate the terminal output to run one-off searches.\n\n### Option 1: Getting started from the Semgrep Appsec Platform (Recommended)\n\n<a href=\"https://go.semgrep.dev/login-ghrmgo\"  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semgrep/semgrep/develop/images/semgrep-main-image.jpg\" alt=\"Semgrep platform image\"/> </a>\n\n1.  Register on <a href=\"https://go.semgrep.dev/login-ghrmgo\" target=\"_blank\">semgrep.dev</a>\n\n2.  Explore the demo findings to learn how Semgrep works\n\n3.  Scan your project by navigating to `Projects > Scan New Project > Run scan in CI`\n\n4.  Select your version control system and follow the onboarding steps to add your project. After this setup, Semgrep will scan your project after every pull request.\n\n5.  [Optional] If you want to run Semgrep locally, follow the steps in the CLI section.\n\n### Notes:\n\nIf there are any issues, <a href=\"https://go.semgrep.dev/slack\" target=\"_blank\">please ask for help in the Semgrep Slack</a>.\n\n### Option 2: Getting started from the CLI\n\n1. Install Semgrep CLI\n\n    ```\n    # For macOS\n    $ brew install semgrep\n\n    # For Ubuntu/WSL/Linux/macOS\n    $ python3 -m pip install semgrep\n\n    # To try Semgrep without installation run via Docker\n    $ docker run -it -v \"${PWD}:/src\" semgrep/semgrep semgrep login\n    $ docker run -e SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=<TOKEN> --rm -v \"${PWD}:/src\" semgrep/semgrep semgrep ci\n    ```\n\n1. Run `semgrep login` to create your account and login to Semgrep. This step is optional, but logging into Semgrep gets you access to:\n\n    - [Semgrep Supply Chain](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=ssc-product): A dependency scanner that detects reachable vulnerabilities in third party libraries\n    - [Semgrep Code's Pro rules](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=code-pro-rules): 600+ high confidence rules written by Semgrep's security research team\n    - [Semgrep Code's Pro engine](https://semgrep.dev/products/pro-engine?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=pro-engine): An advanced code analysis engine, designed to detect complex vulnerabilities, and reduce false positives\n\n1. Go to your app's root directory and run `semgrep ci`. This will scan your project to check for vulnerabilities in your source code and its dependencies.\n\n1. Try writing your own query interactively with `-e`. For example, a check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (potentially a bug):\n    `$ semgrep -e '$X == $X' --lang=py path/to/src`\n\n### Semgrep Ecosystem\n\nThe Semgrep ecosystem includes the following:\n\n- [Semgrep Community Edition](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cli-reference/) - The open-source program analysis engine at the heart of everything. Suitable for ad-hoc use cases with a high tolerance for false positives - think consultants, security auditors, or pentesters.\n\n- [Semgrep AppSec Platform](https://semgrep.dev/login?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=appsec-platform) - Easily orchestrate and scale SAST, SCA, and Secrets scanning across an organization, with no risk of overwhelming developers.  Customize which findings developers see, where they see them, and integrate with CI providers like GitHub, GitLab, CircleCI, and more. Includes both free and paid tiers.\n\n  - [Semgrep Code (SAST)](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=semgrep-code) - Make real progress on your vulnerability backlog with SAST that minimizes noise and empowers developers to quickly fix issues on their own, even if they have no security knowledge. Easy to deploy secure guardrails and tailored, step-by-step remediation guidance mean developers actually fix issues since they don't feel slowed down.  \n\n  - [Semgrep Supply Chain (SSC)](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-supply-chain?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=ssc) - A high-signal dependency scanner that detects reachable vulnerabilities in open source third-party libraries and functions.\n\n  - [Semgrep Secrets (Secrets scanning)](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2023/introducing-semgrep-secrets/) - Secrets detection that uses semantic analysis, improved entropy analysis, and validation to accurately surface sensitive credentials in the developer workflow.\n\n  - [Semgrep Assistant (AI)](https://semgrep.dev/products/semgrep-code/assistant?utm_medium=readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=assistant) - Assistant is an AI-powered AppSec engineer that helps both developers and AppSec teams prioritize, triage, and remediate Semgrep findings at scale. Humans agree with Assistant auto-triage decisions 97% of the time, and rate generated remediation guidance as helpful 80% of the time. For an overview of how Assistant works, [read this overview](https://a.storyblok.com/f/151984/x/2d12dc0223/whitepaper_-ai-powered-appsec-engineer-automate.pdf?cv=1728584410408).\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n- [Semgrep Playground](https://semgrep.dev/editor) - An online interactive tool for writing and sharing rules.\n- [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/explore) - 2,000+ community-driven rules covering security, correctness, and dependency vulnerabilities.\n\nJoin hundreds of thousands of other developers and security engineers already using Semgrep at companies like GitLab, Dropbox, Slack, Figma, Shopify, HashiCorp, Snowflake, and Trail of Bits.\n\nSemgrep is developed and commercially supported by [Semgrep, Inc., a software security company](https://semgrep.dev).\n\n### Semgrep Rules\n\nSemgrep rules look like the code you already write; no abstract syntax trees, regex wrestling, or painful DSLs. Here's a quick rule for finding Python `print()` statements.\n\nRun it online in Semgrep’s Playground by [clicking here](https://semgrep.dev/playground/r/3qUzQD/ievans.print-to-logger).\n\n<p

Extensions\n\nVisit [Docs > Extensions](https://semgrep.dev/docs/extensions/) to learn about using Semgrep in your editor or pre-commit. When integrated into CI and configured to scan pull requests, Semgrep will only report issues introduced by that pull request; this lets you start using Semgrep without fixing or ignoring pre-existing issues!\n\n### Documentation\n\nBrowse the full Semgrep [documentation on the website](https://semgrep.dev/docs). If you’re new to Semgrep, check out [Docs > Getting started](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) or the [interactive tutorial](https://semgrep.dev/learn).\n\n### Metrics\n\nUsing remote configuration from the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r) (like `--config=p/ci`) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.\n\nWhen using configs from local files (like `--config=xyz.yml`), metrics are sent only when the user is logged in.\n\nTo disable Registry rule metrics, use `--metrics=off`.\n\nThe Semgrep [privacy policy](https://semgrep.dev/docs/metrics) describes the principles that guide data-collection decisions and the breakdown of the data that are and are not collected when the metrics are enabled.\n\n### More\n\n- [Frequently asked questions (FAQs)](https://semgrep.dev/docs/faq/)\n- [Contributing](https://semgrep.dev/docs/contributing/contributing/)\n- [Build instructions for developers](INSTALL.md)\n- [Ask questions in the Semgrep community Slack](https://go.semgrep.dev/slack)\n- [CLI reference and exit codes](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cli-usage)\n- [Semgrep YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/semgrep)\n- [License (LGPL-2.1)](LICENSE)\n- [Licensing Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/licensing/)\n\n### Upgrading\n\nTo upgrade, run the command below associated with how you installed Semgrep:\n\n```sh\n# Using Homebrew\n$ brew upgrade semgrep\n\n# Using pip\n$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade semgrep\n\n# Using Docker\n$ docker pull semgrep/semgrep:latest\n```\n",

For example, this includes invoking the package manager (e.g., pip, gradle, maven, yarn,\nnpm, etc.)\nto get dependency information for Snyk Open Source. Invoking these programs on untrusted code that has malicious\nconfigurations may expose your system to malicious code execution and exploits.\n\nTo safeguard from using the language server on untrusted folders, our language server will ask for folder trust\nbefore running scans against these folders. When in doubt, do not grant trust.\n\nThe trust feature is enabled by default. When a folder is trusted, all sub-folders are also trusted. After a folder\nis trusted, Snyk Language Server notifies the Language Server Client with the custom `$/snyk.addTrustedFolders`\nnotification,\nwhich contains a list of currently trusted folder paths. Based on this, a client can then implement logic to intercept\nthis notification and persist the decision and trust in the IDE or Editor storage mechanism.\n\nTrust dialogs can be disabled by setting `enableTrustedFoldersFeature` to `false` in the initialization options. This\nwill disable all trust prompts and checks.\n\nAn initial set of trusted folders can be provided by setting `trustedFolders` to an array of paths in the\n`initializationOptions`. These folders will be trusted on startup and will not prompt the user to trust them.\n\n#### Environment variables\n\nSnyk LS and Snyk CLI support and need certain environment variables to function:\n\n1. `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` to define the http proxy to be used\n1. `JAVA_HOME` to analyse Java JVM-based projects via Snyk CLI\n1. `PATH` to find maven when analysing Maven projects, to find python, etc\n\n#### Auto-Configuration\n\nTo automatically add these variables to the environment, Snyk LS searches for the following files, with the order\ndetermining precedence. If the executable is not called from an already configured environment (e.g. via\n`zsh -i -c 'snyk-ls'`), you can also specify config file with the `-c` command line flag for setting the above mentioned\nvariables. Snyk LS reads the following files in the given precedence and order, not overwriting the already loaded\nvariables.\n\n```bash\ngiven config file via -c flag\n<working-dir>/.snyk.env\n$HOME/.snyk.env\n```\n\nAny lines that contain an environment variable in the format\n`VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE` are added automatically to the environment if not already existent. This adheres to the\n`dotenv` format. In case of `.profile`, `.zshrc`, etc., if a variable is directly exported e.g. via\n`export VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE`, it is not loaded. The export would need to be split of and be in its own line, e.g\n\n```bash\nVARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE\nexport VARIABLENAME\n```\n\nThe PATH variable is treated differently than all other variables, as it is an aggregate of all PATH variables found in\nthe files and in the environment. Also, the current working directory `.` is automatically added to the path, so a\ndownload of the Snyk CLI into the current working directory by an LSP client would yield a found Snyk CLI for the\nLanguage Server.\n\nIn addition to configuring variables via config files, Snyk LS adds the following directories to the path on linux\nand macOS:\n\n- /bin\n- $HOME/bin\n- /usr/local/bin\n- $JAVA_HOME/bin\n\nIf no JAVA_HOME is set, it automatically searches for a java executable first in path, then in the following directories\nand adds the parent directory of its parent as JAVA_HOME. The following directories are recursively searched:\n\n- /usr/lib\n- /usr/java\n- /opt\n- /Library\n- $HOME/.sdkman\n- C:\\Program Files\n- C:\\Program Files (x86)\n\nThe same directories are searched for a maven executable and the parent directory is added to the path.\n\n#### Snyk CLI\n\nTo find the automatically managed Snyk CLI,\nthe [XDG Data Home](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html#variables)\nand `PATH` path are automatically scanned for the OS-dependent file, e.g. `snyk-macos` on macOS,\n`snyk-linux` on Linux and `snyk-win.exe` on Windows, and the first path where it is found is added to the environment.\nIt is later used for all functionality that depends on the CLI.\n\n#### Setting environment variables globally\n\nIf you want to have the environment variables available system-wide, you would need to add the variables\nto `/etc/environment` or on macOS to `/etc/launchd.conf` or set them via `launchctl` in a shell script. The former two\nlocations are automatically read by snyk lsp. On Windows, a user variable can be defined via the UI for the user or\nsystem-wide. In a file like `~/.profile` it would like this:\n\n```bash\nSNYK_TOKEN=<your-token-from-app.snyk.io>\nDEEPROXY_API_URL=https://deeproxy.snyk.io/\n\n# export variables, but make sure the export is not on the same line as the variable definition\nexport SNYK_TOKEN\nexport DEEPROXY_API_URL\n```\n\n#### Authentication to Snyk\n\nThe Snyk LS authentication flow happens automatically, unless disabled in configuration, and is as follows. When Snyk\nLanguage Server starts, it:\n\n- If the endpoint is a snykgov.io endpoint, or the authenticationMethod is set to `oauth`, it authenticates via OAuth2.\n  This opens a browser window.\n- If the authentication method is not `oauth`, it tries to retrieve a token using the Snyk CLI token authentication.\n- If the CLI is not authenticated either, it opens a browser window to authenticate\n- If there are problems opening the browser window, the auth URL can be copied to the clipboard (via implementation\n  of `snyk.copyAuthLink`). _Note that there is a requirement to have `xsel` or `xclip` installed for Linux/Unix users\n  for this feature._\n\nAfter successfull authentication in the web browser, the Snyk Language Server\nautomatically retrieves the Snyk authentication credentials and uses them for further requests.\n\n## Run Tests\n\n```bash\ngo test ./...\n```\n\nIf you have any issues with running pact, please extend your PATH env.\nFor example:\n\n```\nPATH=$PATH:$PWD/.bin/pact/bin make test\n```\n\nThe output should look like this (it is running against the Snyk Code API and using the real CLI):\n\n```\n?       github.com/snyk/snyk-ls        [no test files]\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/code   24.201s\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/diagnostics    26.590s\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/iac    25.780s\n?       github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/lsp    [no test files]\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/oss    22.427s\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/server 48.558s\nok      github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/util   9.562s\n```\n\n## Test Github Action locally\n\nYou can test github actions locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).\n\n### Install act & prerequisites\n\n```bash\nbrew install act\n\n# if you don't have docker desktop you can use minikube (a one-node kubernetes distribution)\nbrew install --cask virtualbox # you need to enable the virtualbox extension in macOS settings\nbrew install minikube\nminikube start\neval $(minikube docker-env) # gives you a fully functional docker environment\n```\n\n### Run act\n\n```bash\nact --secret SNYK_TOKEN=$SNYK_TOKEN --secret DEEPROXY_API_URL=$DEEPROXY_API_URL\n```\n",

Claude Desktop (or other MCP Client)\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nTo deploy this MCP Server with Claude Desktop, you'll need to edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` to add the following:\n\n```\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mythic_mcp\": {\n            \"command\": \"/Users/xpn/.local/bin/uv\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"/full/path/to/mythic_mcp/\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"main.py\",\n                \"mythic_admin\",\n                \"mythic_admin_password\",\n                \"localhost\",\n                \"7443\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnce done, kick off Claude Desktop. There are sample prompts to show how to task the LLM, but really anything will work along the lines of:\n\n```\nYou are an automated pentester, tasked with emulating a specific threat actor. The threat actor is APT31. Your objective is: Add a flag to C:\\win.txt on DC01. Perform any required steps to meet the objective, using only techniques documented by the threat actor.\n```\n",

Download from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Download both `jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar` and `jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip` files.\n\n\n```bash\n# 0. Download the jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar and jadx-mcp-server-<version>.zip\nhttps://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp/releases\n\n# 1. \nunzip jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.zip\n\n├jadx-mcp-server/\n  ├── jadx_mcp.py\n  ├── requirements.txt\n  ├── README.md\n  ├── LICENSE\n\n├jadx-ai-mcp-<version>.jar\n\n# 2. Install the plugin\n\n# For this you can follow two approaches:\n\n## 1. One liner - execute below command in your shell\njadx plugins --install \"github:zinja-coder:jadx-ai-mcp\"\n\n## The above one line code will install the latest version of the plugin directly into the jadx, no need to download the jadx-ai-mcp's .jar file.\n## 2. Or you can use JADX-GUI to install it by following images as shown below:\n```\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    \n</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    \n</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    \n</div>\n\n\n```bash\n## 3. GUI method, download the .jar file and follow below steps shown in images\n```\n\n\n\n\n```bash\n# 3. Navigate to jadx-mcp-server directory\ncd jadx-mcp-server\n\n# 4. This project uses uv - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.\n    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet)\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in jadx-mcp-server, Set up the environment\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\n    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies\nuv pip install httpx fastmcp\n\n# The setup for jadx-ai-mcp and jadx_mcp_server is done.\n```\n\n## 2. Running on Local LLM Using Ollama and Zin MCP Client - Recommended\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client\">\n    <img alt=\"zin-mcp-client\" height=\"360px\" widht=\"480px\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8e0ecd-0520-422e-a007-03dc62c4118e\">\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n⚡ Lightweight, Fast, Simple, CLI-Based MCP Client for STDIO MCP Servers, to fill the gap and provide bridge between your local LLMs running Ollama and MCP Servers.\n\nCheck Now: https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client\n\nDemo: **Perform Code Review to Find Vulnerabilities locally**\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cd26715-b5e6-4b4b-95e4-054de6789f42\n\n## 🤖 3. Use Claude Desktop\n\nMake sure Claude Desktop is running with MCP enabled.\n\nFor instance, I have used following for Kali Linux: https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian\n\nConfigure and add MCP server to LLM file:\n```bash\nnano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nFor:\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   \nAnd following content in it:\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"jadx-mcp-server\": {\n            \"command\": \"/<path>/<to>/uv\", \n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"</PATH/TO/>jadx-mcp-server/\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"jadx_mcp_server.py\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace:\n\n- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable\n- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this\nrepository\n\nThen, navigate code and interact via real-time code review prompts using the built-in integration.\n\n**OR**\n\nor you can install the jadx_mcp_server directly as executable directly using below command:\n\n```\nuv tool install git+https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server\n```\n\nand then you can just provide `jadx_mcp_server` in `command` section of mcp configuration.\n\n## 4. Use Cherry Studio\n\nIf you want to configure the MCP tool in Cherry Studio, you can refer to the following configuration.\n- Type: stdio\n- command: uv\n- argument:\n```bash\n--directory\npath/to/jadx-mcp-server\nrun\njadx_mcp_server.py\n```\n- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this\nrepository\n\n## 5. Using LMStudio\n\nYou can also use JADX AI MCP Server with LM Studio by configuring it's mcp.json file. Here's the video guide.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4a6b280-5aa9-4e76-ac72-a0abec73b809\n\n## 6. Running in HTTP Stream Mode\n\nYou can also use Jadx in HTTP Stream Mode using `--http` option with `jadx_mcp_server.py` as shown in following:\n\n```bash\nuv run jadx_mcp_server.py --http\n\nOR\n\nuv run jadx_mcp_server.py --http --port 9999\n```\n\n## 7. Custom port configuration for JADX AI MCP Plugin\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"335\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6243adc5-5be4-4e2d-aa16-bdaf78a28e36\" />\n\n1. Configure Port: Configure the port on which the JADX AI MCP Plugin will listen on.\n2. Default Port: Revert back the changes and listen on default port.\n3. Restart Server: Force restart the JADX AI MCP Plugin server.\n4. Server Status: Check the status of JADX AI MCP Plugin server.\n\nTo connect with JADX AI MCP Plugin running on custom port, the `--jadx-port` option will be used as shown in following:\n```\nuv run jadx_mcp_server.py --jadx-port 8652\n```\n\nThe MCP Configuration for above will be as follows for claude:\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"jadx-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/path/to/jadx-mcp-server/\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"jadx_mcp_server.py\",\n        \"--jadx-port\",\n        \"8652\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Give it a shot\n\n1. Run jadx-gui and load any .apk file\n\n\n\n2. Start claude - You must see hammer symbol\n\n\n\n3. Click on the `hammer` symbol and you should you see somthing like following:\n\n\n\n4. Run following prompt:\n```text\nfetch currently selected class and perform quick sast on it\n```\n\n\n5. Allow access when prompted:\n\n\n\n6. HACK!\n\n\n\nThis plugin allows total control over the GUI and internal project model to support deeper LLM integration, including:\n\n- Exporting selected class to MCP\n- Running automated Claude analysis\n- Receiving back suggestions inline\n\n---\n\n## 🛣️ Future Roadmap\n\n- [x] Add Support for apktool\n\n - [ ] Add support for hermes code (ReactNative Application)\n\n - [ ] Add more useful MCP Tools\n\n - [ ] Make LLM be able to modify code on JADX\n\n - [ ] Add prompts templates, give llm access to Android APK Files as Resources\n\n - [x] Build MCP Client to support Local LLM\n\n - [ ] **END-GOAL** : Make all android reverse engineering and APK modification tools Connect with single MCP server to make reverse engineering apk files as easy as possible purely from vibes.\n\n\n## NOTE For Contributors\n\n - The files related to JADX-AI-MCP can be found under this repo.\n\n - The files related to **jadx-mcp-server** can be found [here](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-mcp-server).\n\n## To report bugs, issues, feature suggestion, Performance issue, general question, Documentation issue.\n - Kindly open an issue with respective template.\n\n - Tested on Claude Desktop Client, support for other AI will be tested soon!\n\n## 🙏 Credits\n\nThis project is a plugin for JADX, an amazing open-source Android decompiler created and maintained by [@skylot](https://github.com/skylot).
