This is the recommended method for most use cases. Because it supports OAuth, you can connect from clients like [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using just the URL: `https://mcp.apify.com`.\n- `https://mcp.apify.com` streamable transport\n\n**Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: Ideal for local integrations and command-line tools like the Claude for Desktop client.\n- Set the MCP client server command to `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server` and the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable to your Apify API token.\n- See `npx @apify/actors-mcp-server --help` for more options.\n\nYou can find detailed instructions for setting up the MCP server in the [Apify documentation](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/mcp).\n\n# 🤖 MCP clients and examples\n\nTo interact with the Apify MCP server, you can use various MCP clients, such as:\n- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n- [Apify Tester MCP Client](https://apify.com/jiri.spilka/tester-mcp-client)\n- Other clients at [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)\n- More clients at [https://glama.ai/mcp/clients](https://glama.ai/mcp/clients)\n\nWith MCP server integrated, you can ask your AI assistant things like:\n- \"Search the web and summarize recent trends in AI Agents.\"\n- \"Find the top 10 Italian restaurants in San Francisco.\"\n- \"Find and analyze the Instagram profile of The Rock.\"\n- \"Provide a step-by-step guide on using the Model Context Protocol, including source URLs.\"\n- \"What Apify Actors can I use?\"\n\n### Supported clients matrix\n\nThe following table outlines the tested MCP clients and their level of support for key features.\n\n| Client | Dynamic Tool Discovery | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Claude.ai (web)** | ✅ Full | |\n| **Claude Desktop** | 🟡 Partial | Tools may need to be reloaded manually in the client. |\n| **VS Code (Genie)** | ✅ Full | |\n| **Apify Tester MCP Client** | ✅ Full | Designed for testing Apify MCP servers. |\n\nApify MCP Server is compatible with any MCP client that adheres to the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org/), but the level of support for dynamic tool discovery and other features may vary between clients. Therefore, the server uses [mcp-client-capabilities](https://github.com/apify/mcp-client-capabilities) to detect client capabilities and adjust its behavior accordingly.\n\n**Smart tool selection based on client capabilities:**\n\nWhen the `actors` tool category is requested, the server intelligently selects the most appropriate Actor-related tools based on the client's capabilities:\n\n- **Clients with dynamic tool support** (e.g., Claude.ai web, VS Code Genie): The server provides the `add-actor` tool instead of `call-actor`. This allows for a better user experience where users can dynamically discover and add new Actors as tools during their conversation.\n\n- **Clients with limited dynamic tool support** (e.g., Claude Desktop): The server provides the standard `call-actor` tool along with other Actor category tools, ensuring compatibility while maintaining functionality.\n\n# 🪄 Try Apify MCP instantly\n\nWant to try Apify MCP without any setup?\n\nCheck out [Apify Tester MCP Client](https://apify.com/jiri.spilka/tester-mcp-client)\n\nThis interactive, chat-like interface provides an easy way to explore the capabilities of Apify MCP without any local setup.\nJust sign in with your Apify account and start experimenting with web scraping, data extraction, and automation tools!\n\nOr use the MCP bundle file (formerly known as Anthropic Desktop extension file, or DXT) for one-click installation: [Apify MCP server MCPB file](https://github.com/apify/apify-mcp-server/releases/latest/download/apify-mcp-server.mcpb)\n\n# 🛠️ Tools, resources, and prompts\n\nThe MCP server provides a set of tools for interacting with Apify Actors.\nSince the Apify Store is large and growing rapidly, the MCP server provides a way to dynamically discover and use new Actors.\n\n### Actors\n\nAny [Apify Actor](https://apify.com/store) can be used as a tool.\nBy default, the server is pre-configured with one Actor, `apify/rag-web-browser`, and several helper tools.\nThe MCP server loads an Actor's input schema and creates a corresponding MCP tool.\nThis allows the AI agent to know exactly what arguments to pass to the Actor and what to expect in return.\n\n\nFor example, for the `apify/rag-web-browser` Actor, the input parameters are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"restaurants in San Francisco\",\n  \"maxResults\": 3\n}\n```\nYou don't need to manually specify which Actor to call or its input parameters; the LLM handles this automatically.\nWhen a tool is called, the arguments are automatically passed to the Actor by the LLM.\nYou can refer to the specific Actor's documentation for a list of available arguments.\n\n### Helper tools\n\nOne of the most powerful features of using MCP with Apify is dynamic tool discovery.\nIt gives an AI agent the ability to find new tools (Actors) as needed and incorporate them.\nHere are some special MCP operations and how the Apify MCP Server supports them:\n\n- **Apify Actors**: Search for Actors, view their details, and use them as tools for the AI.\n- **Apify documentation**: Search the Apify documentation and fetch specific documents to provide context to the AI.\n- **Actor runs**: Get lists of your Actor runs, inspect their details, and retrieve logs.\n- **Apify storage**: Access data from your datasets and key-value stores.\n\n### Overview of available tools\n\nHere is an overview list of all the tools provided by the Apify MCP Server.\n\n| Tool name | Category | Description | Enabled by default |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| `search-actors` | actors | Search for Actors in the Apify Store. | ✅ |\n| `fetch-actor-details` | actors | Retrieve detailed information about a specific Actor. | ✅ |\n| `call-actor` | actors | Call an Actor and get its run results. | ✅ |\n| [`apify-slash-rag-web-browser`](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser) | Actor (see [tool configuration](#tools-configuration)) | An Actor tool to browse the web. | ✅ |\n| `search-apify-docs` | docs | Search the Apify documentation for relevant pages. | ✅ |\n| `fetch-apify-docs` | docs | Fetch the full content of an Apify documentation page by its URL. | ✅ |\n| `get-actor-run` | runs | Get detailed information about a specific Actor run. |  |\n| `get-actor-run-list` | runs | Get a list of an Actor's runs, filterable by status. |  |\n| `get-actor-log` | runs | Retrieve the logs for a specific Actor run. |  |\n| `get-dataset` | storage | Get metadata about a specific dataset. |  |\n| `get-dataset-items` | storage | Retrieve items from a dataset with support for filtering and pagination. |  |\n| `get-dataset-schema` | storage | Generate a JSON schema from dataset items. |  |\n| `get-key-value-store` | storage | Get metadata about a specific key-value store. |  |\n| `get-key-value-store-keys`| storage | List the keys within a specific key-value store. |  |\n| `get-key-value-store-record`| storage | Get the value associated with a specific key in a key-value store. |  |\n| `get-dataset-list` | storage | List all available datasets for the user. |  |\n| `get-key-value-store-list`| storage | List all available key-value stores for the user. |  |\n| `add-actor` | experimental | Add an Actor as a new tool for the user to call. |  |\n| `get-actor-output`* | - | Retrieve the output from an Actor call which is not included in the output preview of the Actor tool. | ✅ |\n\n> **Note:**\n>\n> When using the `actors` tool category, clients that support dynamic tool discovery (like Claude.ai web and VS Code) automatically receive the `add-actor` tool instead of `call-actor` for enhanced Actor discovery capabilities.\n\n> The `get-actor-output` tool is automatically included with any Actor-related tool, such as `call-actor`, `add-actor`, or any specific Actor tool like `apify-slash-rag-web-browser`. When you call an Actor - either through the `call-actor` tool or directly via an Actor tool (e.g., `apify-slash-rag-web-browser`) - you receive a preview of the output. The preview depends on the Actor's output format and length; for some Actors and runs, it may include the entire output, while for others, only a limited version is returned to avoid overwhelming the LLM. To retrieve the full output of an Actor run, use the `get-actor-output` tool (supports limit, offset, and field filtering) with the `datasetId` provided by the Actor call.\n\n### Tools configuration\n\nThe `tools` configuration parameter is used to specify loaded tools - either categories or specific tools directly, and Apify Actors. For example, `tools=storage,runs` loads two categories; `tools=add-actor` loads just one tool.\n\nWhen no query parameters are provided, the MCP server loads the following `tools` by default:\n\n- `actors`\n- `docs`\n- `apify/rag-web-browser`\n\nIf the tools parameter is specified, only the listed tools or categories will be enabled - no default tools will be included.\n\n> **Easy configuration:**\n>\n> Use the [UI configurator](https://mcp.apify.com/) to configure your server, then copy the configuration to your client.\n\n**Configuring the hosted server:**\n\nThe hosted server can be configured using query parameters in the URL. For example, to load the default tools, use:\n\n```\nhttps://mcp.apify.com?tools=actors,docs,apify/rag-web-browser\n```\n\nFor minimal configuration, if you want to use only a single Actor tool - without any discovery or generic calling tools, the server can be configured as follows:\n\n```\nhttps://mcp.apify.com?tools=apify/my-actor\n```\n\nThis setup exposes only the specified Actor (`apify/my-actor`) as a tool. No other tools will be available.\n\n**Configuring the CLI:**\n\nThe CLI can be configured using command-line flags. For example, to load the same tools as in the hosted server configuration, use:\n\n```bash\nnpx @apify/actors-mcp-server --tools actors,docs,apify/rag-web-browser\n```\n\nThe minimal configuration is similar to the hosted server configuration:\n\n```bash\nnpx @apify/actors-mcp-server --tools apify/my-actor\n```\n\nAs above, this exposes only the specified Actor (`apify/my-actor`) as a tool. No other tools will be available.\n\n> **⚠️ Important recommendation**\n>\n> **The default tools configuration may change in future versions.** When no `tools` parameter is specified, the server currently loads default tools, but this behavior is subject to change.\n>\n> **For production use and stable interfaces, always explicitly specify the `tools` parameter** to ensure your configuration remains consistent across updates.\n\n### Backward compatibility\n\nThe v2 configuration preserves backward compatibility with v1 usage. Notes:\n\n- `actors` param (URL) and `--actors` flag (CLI) are still supported.\n  - Internally they are merged into `tools` selectors.\n  - Examples: `?actors=apify/rag-web-browser` ≡ `?tools=apify/rag-web-browser`; `--actors apify/rag-web-browser` ≡ `--tools apify/rag-web-browser`.\n- `enable-adding-actors` (CLI) and `enableAddingActors` (URL) are supported but deprecated.\n  - Prefer `tools=experimental` or including the specific tool `tools=add-actor`.\n  - Behavior remains: when enabled with no `tools` specified, the server exposes only `add-actor`; when categories/tools are selected, `add-actor` is also included.\n- `enableActorAutoLoading` remains as a legacy alias for `enableAddingActors` and is mapped automatically.\n- Defaults remain compatible: when no `tools` are specified, the server loads `actors`, `docs`, and `apify/rag-web-browser`.\n  - If any `tools` are specified, the defaults are not added (same as v1 intent for explicit selection).\n- `call-actor` is now included by default via the `actors` category (additive change). To exclude it, specify an explicit `tools` list without `actors`.\n- `preview` category is deprecated and removed. Use specific tool names instead.\n\nExisting URLs and commands using `?actors=...` or `--actors` continue to work unchanged.\n\n### Prompts\n\nThe server provides a set of predefined example prompts to help you get started interacting with Apify through MCP. For example, there is a `GetLatestNewsOnTopic` prompt that allows you to easily retrieve the latest news on a specific topic using the [RAG Web Browser](https://apify.com/apify/rag-web-browser) Actor.\n\n### Resources\n\nThe server does not yet provide any resources.\n\n### Debugging the NPM package\n\nTo debug the server, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) tool:\n\n```shell\nexport APIFY_TOKEN=\"your-apify-token\"\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y @apify/actors-mcp-server\n```\n\n# ⚙️ Development\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher)\n\nCreate an environment file, `.env`, with the following content:\n```text\nAPIFY_TOKEN=\"your-apify-token\"\n```\n\nBuild the `actor-mcp-server` package:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Start HTTP streamable MCP server\n\nRun using Apify CLI:\n\n```bash\nexport APIFY_TOKEN=\"your-apify-token\"\nexport APIFY_META_ORIGIN=STANDBY\napify run -p\n```\n\nOnce the server is running, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to debug the server exposed at `http://localhost:3001`.\n\n## Start standard input/output (stdio) MCP server\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector with this command:\n\n```bash\nexport APIFY_TOKEN=\"your-apify-token\"\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./dist/stdio.js\n```\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can open in your browser to begin debugging.\n\n## 🐦 Canary PR releases\n\nApify MCP is split across two repositories: this one for core MCP logic and the private `apify-mcp-server-internal` for the hosted server.\nChanges must be synchronized between both.\n\nTo create a canary release, add the `beta` tag to your PR branch.\nThis publishes the package to [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new/) for staging and testing before merging.\nSee [the workflow file](.github/workflows/pre_release.yaml) for details.\n\n## 🐋 Docker Hub integration\nThe Apify MCP Server is also available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/mcp/server/apify-mcp-server/overview), registered via the [mcp-registry](https://github.com/docker/mcp-registry) repository. The entry in `servers/apify-mcp-server/server.yaml` should be deployed automatically by the Docker Hub MCP registry (deployment frequency is unknown). **Before making major changes to the `stdio` server version, be sure to test it locally to ensure the Docker build passes.** To test, change the `source.branch` to your PR branch and run `task build -- apify-mcp-server`. For more details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/docker/mcp-registry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n# 🐛 Troubleshooting (local MCP server)\n\n- Make sure you have `node` installed by running `node -v`.\n- Make sure the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable is set.\n- Always use the latest version of the MCP server by using `@apify/actors-mcp-server@latest`.\n\n## 💡 Limitations\n\nThe Actor input schema is processed to be compatible with most MCP clients while adhering to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) standards. The processing includes:\n- **Descriptions** are truncated to 500 characters (as defined in `MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`).\n- **Enum fields** are truncated to a maximum combined length of 200 characters for all elements (as defined in `ACTOR_ENUM_MAX_LENGTH`).\n- **Required fields** are explicitly marked with a `REQUIRED` prefix in their descriptions for compatibility with frameworks that may not handle the JSON schema properly.\n- **Nested properties** are built for special cases like proxy configuration and request list sources to ensure the correct input structure.\n- **Array item types** are inferred when not explicitly defined in the schema, using a priority order: explicit type in items > prefill type > default value type > editor type.\n- **Enum values and examples** are added to property descriptions to ensure visibility, even if the client doesn't fully support the JSON schema.\n- **Rental Actors** are only available for use with the hosted MCP server at https://mcp.apify.com. When running the server locally via stdio, you can only access Actors that are already added to your local toolset. To dynamically search for and use any Actor from the Apify Store—including rental Actors—connect to the hosted endpoint.\n\n# 🤝 Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to improve the Apify MCP Server!

This section provides an overview of how to extend the Base MCP server with new capabilities.\n\n### Adding New Tools\n\nIf you want to add a new tool to the Base MCP server, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new directory in the `src/tools` directory for your tool\n2. Implement the tool following the existing patterns:\n   - `index.ts`: Define and export your tools. Tools are defined as AgentKit ActionProviders.\n   - `schemas.ts`: Define input schemas for your tools\n   - `types.ts`: Define types required for your tools\n   - `utils.ts`: Utilities for your tools\n3. Add your tool to the list of available tools in `src/main.ts`\n4. Add documentation for your tool in the README.md\n5. Add examples of how to use your tool in examples.md\n6. Write tests for your tool\n\n### Project Structure\n\nThe Base MCP server follows this structure for tools:\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── tools/\n│   ├── [TOOL_NAME]/ <-------------------------- ADD DIR HERE\n│   │   ├── index.ts (defines and exports tools)\n│   │   ├── schemas.ts (defines input schema)\n│   └── utils/ (shared tool utilities)\n```\n\n### Best Practices for Tool Development\n\nWhen developing new tools for Base MCP:\n\n- Follow the existing code style and patterns\n- Ensure your tool has a clear, focused purpose\n- Provide comprehensive input validation\n- Include detailed error handling\n- Write thorough documentation\n- Add examples demonstrating how to use your tool\n- Include tests for your tool\n\nFor more detailed information on contributing to Base MCP, including adding new tools and protocols, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v16 or higher)\n- npm or yarn\n- Coinbase API credentials (API Key Name and Private Key)\n- A wallet seed phrase\n- Coinbase Project ID (for onramp functionality)\n- Alchemy API Key (required for NFT functionality)\n- Optional: OpenRouter API Key (for buying OpenRouter credits)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Install from npm (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Install globally\nnpm install -g base-mcp\n\n# Or install locally in your project\nnpm install base-mcp\n```\n\nOnce the package is installed, you can configure clients with the following command:\n\n```bash\nbase-mcp --init\n```\n\n### Option 2: Install from Source\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/base/base-mcp.git\n   cd base-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Build the project:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n4. Optionally, link it globally:\n   ```bash\n   npm link\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\nCreate a `.env` file with your credentials:\n\n```\n# Coinbase API credentials\n# You can obtain these from the Coinbase Developer Portal: https://cdp.coinbase.com/\nCOINBASE_API_KEY_NAME=your_api_key_name\nCOINBASE_API_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key\n\n# Wallet seed phrase (12 or 24 words)\n# This is the mnemonic phrase for your wallet\nSEED_PHRASE=your seed phrase here\n\n# Coinbase Project ID (for onramp functionality)\n# You can obtain this from the Coinbase Developer Portal\nCOINBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id\n\n# Alchemy API Key (required for NFT functionality)\n# You can obtain this from https://alchemy.com\nALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key\n\n# OpenRouter API Key (optional for buying OpenRouter credits)\n# You can obtain this from https://openrouter.ai/keys\nOPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key\n\n# Chain ID (optional for Base Sepolia testnet)\n# Use 84532 for Base Sepolia testnet\n# You do not have to include this if you want to use Base Mainnet\nCHAIN_ID=your_chain_id\n\n# Neynar API Key (required for Farcaster functionality)\n# You can obtain this from https://neynar.com\nNEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nTest the MCP server to verify it's working correctly:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis script will verify that your MCP server is working correctly by testing the connection and available tools.\n\n## Examples\n\nSee the [examples.md](examples.md) file for detailed examples of how to interact with the Base MCP tools through Claude.\n\n## Integration with Claude Desktop\n\nTo add this MCP server to Claude Desktop:\n\n1.

      "readme_content": "# Browserbase MCP Server\n\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@browserbasehq/mcp-browserbase)](https://smithery.ai/server/@browserbasehq/mcp-browserbase)\n\n![cover](assets/cover-mcp.png)\n\n[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.\n\nThis server provides cloud browser automation capabilities using [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) and [Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand). It enables LLMs to interact with web pages, take screenshots, extract information, and perform automated actions with atomic precision.\n\n## Features\n\n| Feature            | Description                                                 |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Browser Automation | Control and orchestrate cloud browsers via Browserbase      |\n| Data Extraction    | Extract structured data from any webpage                    |\n| Web Interaction    | Navigate, click, and fill forms with ease                   |\n| Screenshots        | Capture full-page and element screenshots                   |\n| Model Flexibility  | Supports multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and more) |\n| Vision Support     | Use annotated screenshots for complex DOMs                  |\n| Session Management | Create, manage, and close browser sessions                  |\n| Multi-Session      | Run multiple browser sessions in parallel                   |\n\n## How to Setup\n\n### Quickstarts:\n\n#### Add to Cursor\n\nCopy and Paste this link in your Browser:\n\n```text\ncursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=browserbase&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IEBicm93c2VyYmFzZWhxL21jcCIsImVudiI6eyJCUk9XU0VSQkFTRV9BUElfS0VZIjoiIiwiQlJPV1NFUkJBU0VfUFJPSkVDVF9JRCI6IiIsIkdFTUlOSV9BUElfS0VZIjoiIn19\n```\n\nWe currently support 2 transports for our MCP server, STDIO and SHTTP. We recommend you use SHTTP with our remote hosted url to take advantage of the server at full capacity.\n\n## SHTTP:\n\nTo use the Browserbase MCP Server through our remote hosted URL, add the following to your configuration.\n\nGo to [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/server/@browserbasehq/mcp-browserbase) and enter your API keys and configuration to get a remote hosted URL.\nWhen using our remote hosted server, we provide the LLM costs for Gemini, the [best performing model](https://www.stagehand.dev/evals) in [Stagehand](https://www.stagehand.dev).\n\n![Smithery Image](assets/smithery.jpg)\n\nIf your client supports SHTTP:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"url\": \"your-smithery-url.com\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf your client doesn't support SHTTP:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"your-smithery-url.com\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## STDIO:\n\nYou can either use our Server hosted on NPM or run it completely locally by cloning this repo.\n\n> **❗️ Important:** If you want to use a different model you have to add --modelName to the args and provide that respective key as an arg. More info below.\n\n### To run on NPM (Recommended)\n\nGo into your MCP Config JSON and add the Browserbase Server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! Reload your MCP client and Claude will be able to use Browserbase.\n\n### To run 100% local:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase.git\ncd mcp-server-browserbase\n\n# Install the dependencies and build the project\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nThen in your MCP Config JSON run the server. To run locally we can use STDIO or self-host SHTTP.\n\n### STDIO:\n\nTo your MCP Config JSON file add the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/mcp-server-browserbase/cli.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen reload your MCP client and you should be good to go!\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe Browserbase MCP server accepts the following command-line flags:\n\n| Flag                       | Description                                                                 |\n| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `--proxies`                | Enable Browserbase proxies for the session                                  |\n| `--advancedStealth`        | Enable Browserbase Advanced Stealth (Only for Scale Plan Users)             |\n| `--keepAlive`              | Enable Browserbase Keep Alive Session                                       |\n| `--contextId <contextId>`  | Specify a Browserbase Context ID to use                                     |\n| `--persist`                | Whether to persist the Browserbase context (default: true)                  |\n| `--port <port>`            | Port to listen on for HTTP/SHTTP transport                                  |\n| `--host <host>`            | Host to bind server to (default: localhost, use 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces) |\n| `--cookies [json]`         | JSON array of cookies to inject into the browser                            |\n| `--browserWidth <width>`   | Browser viewport width (default: 1024)                                      |\n| `--browserHeight <height>` | Browser viewport height (default: 768)                                      |\n| `--modelName <model>`      | The model to use for Stagehand (default: google/gemini-2.0-flash)           |\n| `--modelApiKey <key>`      | API key for the custom model provider (required when using custom models)   |\n| `--experimental`           | Enable experimental features (default: false)                               |\n\nThese flags can be passed directly to the CLI or configured in your MCP configuration file.\n\n### NOTE:\n\nCurrently, these flags can only be used with the local server (npx @browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase).\n\n## Configuration Examples\n\n### Proxies\n\nHere are our docs on [Proxies](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/proxies).\n\nTo use proxies, set the --proxies flag in your MCP Config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\", \"--proxies\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Advanced Stealth\n\nHere are our docs on [Advanced Stealth](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/stealth-mode#advanced-stealth-mode).\n\nTo use advanced stealth, set the --advancedStealth flag in your MCP Config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\", \"--advancedStealth\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Contexts\n\nHere are our docs on [Contexts](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/contexts)\n\nTo use contexts, set the --contextId flag in your MCP Config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\",\n        \"--contextId\",\n        \"<YOUR_CONTEXT_ID>\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Browser Viewport Sizing\n\nThe default viewport sizing for a browser session is 1024 x 768. You can adjust the Browser viewport sizing with browserWidth and browserHeight flags.\n\nHere's how to use it for custom browser sizing. We recommend to stick with 16:9 aspect ratios (ie: 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720, 1024 x 768)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\",\n        \"--browserHeight 1080\",\n        \"--browserWidth 1920\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\",\n        \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Model Configuration\n\nStagehand defaults to using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, but you can configure it to use other models like GPT-4o, Claude, or other providers.\n\n**Important**: When using any custom model (non-default), you must provide your own API key for that model provider using the `--modelApiKey` flag.\n\nHere's how to configure different models:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"browserbase\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@browserbasehq/mcp-server-browserbase\",\n        \"--modelName\",\n        \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\",\n        \"--modelApiKey\",\n        \"your-anthropic-api-key\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BROWSERBASE_API_KEY\": \"\",\n        \"BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n_Note: The model must be supported in Stagehand. Check out the docs [here](https://docs.stagehand.dev/examples/custom_llms#supported-llms). When using any custom model, you must provide your own API key for that provider._\n\n### Resources\n\nThe server provides access to screenshot resources:\n\n1. **Screenshots** (`screenshot://<screenshot-name>`)\n   - PNG images of captured screenshots\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **AI-Powered Automation**: Natural language commands for web interactions\n- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and more\n- **Advanced Session Management**: Single and multi-session support for parallel browser automation\n- **Screenshot Capture**: Full-page and element-specific screenshots\n- **Data Extraction**: Intelligent content extraction from web pages\n- **Proxy Support**: Enterprise-grade proxy capabilities\n- **Stealth Mode**: Advanced anti-detection features\n- **Context Persistence**: Maintain authentication and state across sessions\n- **Parallel Workflows**: Run multiple browser sessions simultaneously for complex automation tasks\n\nFor more information about the Model Context Protocol, visit:\n\n- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs)\n- [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n\nFor the official MCP Docs:\n\n- [Browserbase MCP](https://docs.browserbase.com/integrations/mcp/introduction)\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\nCopyright 2025 Browserbase, Inc.\n",

If you are looking for [Package Search](https://www.trychroma.com/package-search) you can find the repository for that [here](https://github.com/chroma-core/package-search).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Flexible Client Types**\n  - Ephemeral (in-memory) for testing and development\n  - Persistent for file-based storage\n  - HTTP client for self-hosted Chroma instances\n  - Cloud client for Chroma Cloud integration (automatically connects to api.trychroma.com)\n\n- **Collection Management**\n  - Create, modify, and delete collections\n  - List all collections with pagination support\n  - Get collection information and statistics\n  - Configure HNSW parameters for optimized vector search\n  - Select embedding functions when creating collections\n\n- **Document Operations**\n  - Add documents with optional metadata and custom IDs\n  - Query documents using semantic search\n  - Advanced filtering using metadata and document content\n  - Retrieve documents by IDs or filters\n  - Full text search capabilities\n\n### Supported Tools\n\n- `chroma_list_collections` - List all collections with pagination support\n- `chroma_create_collection` - Create a new collection with optional HNSW configuration\n- `chroma_peek_collection` - View a sample of documents in a collection\n- `chroma_get_collection_info` - Get detailed information about a collection\n- `chroma_get_collection_count` - Get the number of documents in a collection\n- `chroma_modify_collection` - Update a collection's name or metadata\n- `chroma_delete_collection` - Delete a collection\n- `chroma_add_documents` - Add documents with optional metadata and custom IDs\n- `chroma_query_documents` - Query documents using semantic search with advanced filtering\n- `chroma_get_documents` - Retrieve documents by IDs or filters with pagination\n- `chroma_update_documents` - Update existing documents' content, metadata, or embeddings\n- `chroma_delete_documents` - Delete specific documents from a collection\n\n### Embedding Functions\nChroma MCP supports several embedding functions: `default`, `cohere`, `openai`, `jina`, `voyageai`, and `roboflow`.\n\nThe embedding functions utilize Chroma's collection configuration, which persists the selected embedding function of a collection for retrieval. Once a collection is created using the collection configuration, on retrieval for future queries and inserts, the same embedding function will be used, without needing to specify the embedding function again. Embedding function persistance was added in v1.0.0 of Chroma, so if you created a collection using version <=0.6.3, this feature is not supported.\n\nWhen accessing embedding functions that utilize external APIs, please be sure to add the environment variable for the API key with the correct format, found in [Embedding Function Environment Variables](#embedding-function-environment-variables)\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop\n\n1. To add an ephemeral client, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"chroma\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n        \"chroma-mcp\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n2. To add a persistent client, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"chroma\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n        \"chroma-mcp\",\n        \"--client-type\",\n        \"persistent\",\n        \"--data-dir\",\n        \"/full/path/to/your/data/directory\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a persistent client that will use the data directory specified.\n\n3. To connect to Chroma Cloud, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"chroma\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n        \"chroma-mcp\",\n        \"--client-type\",\n        \"cloud\",\n        \"--tenant\",\n        \"your-tenant-id\",\n        \"--database\",\n        \"your-database-name\",\n        \"--api-key\",\n        \"your-api-key\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a cloud client that automatically connects to api.trychroma.com using SSL.\n\n**Note:** Adding API keys in arguments is fine on local devices, but for safety, you can also specify a custom path for your environment configuration file using the `--dotenv-path` argument within the `args` list, for example: `\"args\": [\"chroma-mcp\", \"--dotenv-path\", \"/custom/path/.env\"]`.\n\n4. To connect to a [self-hosted Chroma instance on your own cloud provider](https://docs.trychroma.com/\nproduction/deployment), add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"chroma\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"chroma-mcp\", \n      \"--client-type\", \n      \"http\", \n      \"--host\", \n      \"your-host\", \n      \"--port\", \n      \"your-port\", \n      \"--custom-auth-credentials\",\n      \"your-custom-auth-credentials\",\n      \"--ssl\",\n      \"true\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will create an HTTP client that connects to your self-hosted Chroma instance.\n\n### Demos\n\nFind reference usages, such as shared knowledge bases & adding memory to context windows in the [Chroma MCP Docs](https://docs.trychroma.com/integrations/frameworks/anthropic-mcp#using-chroma-with-claude)\n\n### Using Environment Variables\n\nYou can also use environment variables to configure the client. The server will automatically load variables from a `.env` file located at the path specified by `--dotenv-path` (defaults to `.chroma_env` in the working directory) or from system environment variables. Command-line arguments take precedence over environment variables.\n\n```bash\n# Common variables\nexport CHROMA_CLIENT_TYPE=\"http\"  # or \"cloud\", \"persistent\", \"ephemeral\"\n\n# For persistent client\nexport CHROMA_DATA_DIR=\"/full/path/to/your/data/directory\"\n\n# For cloud client (Chroma Cloud)\nexport CHROMA_TENANT=\"your-tenant-id\"\nexport CHROMA_DATABASE=\"your-database-name\"\nexport CHROMA_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n\n# For HTTP client (self-hosted)\nexport CHROMA_HOST=\"your-host\"\nexport CHROMA_PORT=\"your-port\"\nexport CHROMA_CUSTOM_AUTH_CREDENTIALS=\"your-custom-auth-credentials\"\nexport CHROMA_SSL=\"true\"\n\n# Optional: Specify path to .env file (defaults to .chroma_env)\nexport CHROMA_DOTENV_PATH=\"/path/to/your/.env\" \n```\n\n#### Embedding Function Environment Variables\nWhen using external embedding functions that access an API key, follow the naming convention\n`CHROMA_<>_API_KEY=\"<key>\"`.\nSo to set a Cohere API key, set the environment variable `CHROMA_COHERE_API_KEY=\"\"`. We recommend adding this to a .env file somewhere and using the `CHROMA_DOTENV_PATH` environment variable or `--dotenv-path` flag to set that location for safekeeping.\n",

      "readme_content": "# Cloudflare MCP Server\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is a [new, standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. In this repository, you can find several MCP servers allowing you to connect to Cloudflare's service from an MCP client (e.g. Cursor, Claude) and use natural language to accomplish tasks through your Cloudflare account.\n\nThese MCP servers allow your [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) to read configurations from your account, process information, make suggestions based on data, and even make those suggested changes for you. All of these actions can happen across Cloudflare's many services including application development, security and performance.\n\nThe following servers are included in this repository:\n\n| Server

client\n\nIf your MCP client has first class support for remote MCP servers, the client will provide a way to accept the server URL directly within its interface (e.g. [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/))\n\nIf your client does not yet support remote MCP servers, you will need to set up its respective configuration file using mcp-remote (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) to specify which servers your client can access.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"mcpServers\": {\n\t\t\"cloudflare-observability\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse\"]\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"cloudflare-bindings\": {\n\t\t\t\"command\": \"npx\",\n\t\t\t\"args\": [\"mcp-remote\", \"https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse\"]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Using Cloudflare's MCP servers from the OpenAI Responses API\n\nTo use one of Cloudflare's MCP servers with [OpenAI's responses API](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/), you will need to provide the Responses API with an API token that has the scopes (permissions) required for that particular MCP server.\n\nFor example, to use the [Browser Rendering MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/browser-rendering) with OpenAI, create an API token in the Cloudflare dashboard [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens), with the following permissions:\n\n<img width=\"937\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-05-21 at 10 38 02 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/872e253f-23ce-43b3-983c-45f9d0f66100\" />\n\n## Need access to more Cloudflare tools?\n\nWe're continuing to add more functionality to this remote MCP server repo. If you'd like to leave feedback, file a bug or provide a feature request, [please open an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/issues/new/choose) on this repository\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n\"Claude's response was interrupted ... \"\n\nIf you see this message, Claude likely hit its context-length limit and stopped mid-reply. This happens most often on servers that trigger many chained tool calls such as the observability server.\n\nTo reduce the chance of running in to this issue:\n\n- Try to be specific, keep your queries concise.\n- If a single request calls multiple tools, try to to break it into several smaller tool calls to keep the responses short.\n\n## Paid Features\n\nSome features may require a paid Cloudflare Workers plan. Ensure your Cloudflare account has the necessary subscription level for the features you intend to use.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing, and running this server locally? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n",

For production use, we recommend using the direct process execution approach shown in the IDE integration examples.\n\n## 🚀 What is Opik MCP Server?\n\nOpik MCP Server is an open-source implementation of the Model Context Protocol for the Opik platform. It provides a unified interface for interacting with Opik's capabilities, supporting multiple transport mechanisms for flexible integration into various environments.\n\n<br>\n\nYou can use Opik MCP Server for:\n* **IDE Integration:**\n  * Seamlessly integrate with Cursor and other compatible IDEs\n  * Provide direct access to Opik's capabilities from your development environment\n\n* **Unified API Access:**\n  * Access all Opik features through a standardized protocol\n  * Leverage multiple transport options (stdio, SSE) for different integration scenarios\n\n* **Platform Management:**\n  * Manage prompts, projects, traces, and metrics through a consistent interface\n  * Organize and monitor your LLM applications efficiently\n\n## Features\n\n- **Prompts Management**: Create, list, update, and delete prompts\n- **Projects/Workspaces Management**: Organize and manage projects\n- **Traces**: Track and analyze trace data\n- **Metrics**: Gather and query metrics data\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Cursor Integration\n\nTo integrate with Cursor IDE, open to the Cursor settings page and navigate\nto the Features tab. If you scroll down to the MCP section you will see the\nbutton `+ Add new MCP server` that will allow you to add the Opik MCP server.\n\nOnce the `New MCP server` modal is open, select `command` as the server type and\nenter the command: `npx -y opik-mcp --apiKey YOUR_API_KEY`.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project and add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"opik\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"opik-mcp\",\n        \"--apiKey\",\n        \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: If you are using the Open-Source version of Opik, you will need to specify\nthe `apiBaseUrl` parameter as `http://localhost:5173/api`.\n\n#### Windsurf Installation\n\nTo install the MCP server in Windsurf, you will need to open the Windsurf settings\nand navigate to the MCP section. From there, click on `View raw config` and update\nthe configuration object to be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"opik\": {\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"-y\",\n          \"opik-mcp\",\n          \"--apiKey\",\n          \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nNote: If you are using the Open-Source version of Opik, you will need to specify\nthe `apiBaseUrl` parameter as `http://localhost:5173/api`.\n\n#### Manual Installation\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/comet-ml/opik-mcp.git\ncd opik-mcp\n\n# Install dependencies and build\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n**Configuration**\n\nCreate a `.env` file based on the example:\n\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env with your specific configuration\n```\n\n**Starting the Server**\n\n```bash\n# Start with stdio transport (default)\nnpm run start:stdio\n\n# Start with SSE transport for network access (experimental)\nnpm run start:sse\n```\n\n## Transport Options\n\n### Standard Input/Output\n\nIdeal for local integration where the client and server run on the same machine.\n\n```bash\nmake start-stdio\n```\n\n### Server-Sent Events (SSE)\n\nEnables remote access and multiple simultaneous clients over HTTP. Note that this transport option is experimental.\n\n```bash\nmake start-sse\n```\n\nFor detailed information about the SSE transport, see [docs/sse-transport.md](docs/sse-transport.md).\n\n## Development\n\n### Testing\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run specific test suite\nnpm test -- tests/transports/sse-transport.test.ts\n```\n\n### Pre-commit Hooks\n\nThis project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:\n\n```bash\n# Run pre-commit checks manually\nmake precommit\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [SSE Transport](docs/sse-transport.md) - Details on using the SSE transport\n- [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md) - Complete API documentation\n- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) - Advanced configuration options\n- [IDE Integration](docs/ide-integration.md) - Integration with Cursor IDE\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use this project in your research, please cite it as follows:\n\n```\nComet ML, Inc, Koc, V., & Boiko, Y.

Update your .env file with the credentials:\n   ```plaintext\n   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here\n   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here\n   ```\n\n### Updating .env file with LLM parameters\n\nYou need to set an LLM, but you can use a local one too:\n\n- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)\n- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\n- AWS Bedrock Anthropic\n- Google Gemini\n- Groq Llama 3.3 70B\n- Ollama (local)\n\nFor the LLM, you can use Anthropic, OpenAI, or Anthropic on AWS Bedrock. You\ncan also use Ollama by setting the following enviroment variables:\n\n```sh\nOLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api\nNEXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_MODEL=phi3\n```\n\nNote: If you need to access Ollama hosted locally and the application is running on Docker setup, you can use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api` as the base URL. You might also need to set `OLLAMA_HOST` to `0.0.0.0` in the Ollama configuration file.\n\nYou can select the model you wish to use in the app on the `/settings` page of the app.\n\nIf you are using local ollama, you can set it to be default:\n\n```sh\nDEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama\n```\n\nIf this is the case you must also set the `ECONOMY_LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable.\n\n### Redis and Postgres\n\nWe use Postgres for the database.\nFor Redis, you can use [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) or set up your own Redis instance.\n\nYou can run Postgres & Redis locally using `docker-compose`\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d # -d will run the services in the background\n```\n\n### Running the app\n\nTo run the migrations:\n\n```bash\npnpm prisma migrate dev\n```\n\nTo run the app locally for development (slower):\n\n```bash\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nOr from the project root:\n\n```bash\nturbo dev\n```\n\nTo build and run the app locally in production mode (faster):\n\n```bash\npnpm run build\npnpm start\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.\n\n### Premium\n\nMany features are available only to premium users. To upgrade yourself, make yourself an admin in the `.env`: `ADMINS=hello@gmail.com`\nThen upgrade yourself at: [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).\n\n### Set up push notifications via Google PubSub to handle emails in real time\n\nFollow instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push).\n\n1. [Create a topic](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#create_a_topic)\n2. [Create a subscription](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#create_a_subscription)\n3. [Grant publish rights on your topic](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#grant_publish_rights_on_your_topic)\n\nSet env var `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC_NAME`.\nWhen creating the subscription select Push and the url should look something like: `https://www.getinboxzero.com/api/google/webhook?token=TOKEN` or `https://abc.ngrok-free.app/api/google/webhook?token=TOKEN` where the domain is your domain. Set `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` in your `.env` file to be the value of `TOKEN`.\n\nTo run in development ngrok can be helpful:\n\n```sh\nngrok http 3000\n# or with an ngrok domain to keep your endpoint stable (set `XYZ`):\nngrok http --domain=XYZ.ngrok-free.app 3000\n```\n\nAnd then update the webhook endpoint in the [Google PubSub subscriptions dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/list).\n\nTo start watching emails visit: `/api/watch/all`\n\n### Watching for email updates\n\nSet a cron job to run these:\nThe Google watch is necessary. Others are optional.\n\n```json\n  \"crons\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/api/watch/all\",\n      \"schedule\": \"0 1 * * *\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/api/resend/summary/all\",\n      \"schedule\": \"0 16 * * 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/api/reply-tracker/disable-unused-auto-draft\",\n      \"schedule\": \"0 3 * * *\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n[Here](https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-setup-cron-jobs-on-vercel#alternative-cron-providers) are some easy ways to run cron jobs. Upstash is a free, easy option. I could never get the Vercel `vercel.json`. Open to PRs if you find a fix for that.\n\n### Docker Build Instructions\n\nWhen building the Docker image, you **must** specify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` as a build argument. This is because Next.js embeds `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables at build time, not runtime.\n\n### Building the Docker image\n\n```bash\n# For production with your custom domain\ndocker build \\\n  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=\"https://your-domain.com\" \\\n  -t inbox-zero \\\n  -f docker/Dockerfile.prod .\n\n# For local development (default)\ndocker build -t inbox-zero -f docker/Dockerfile.prod .\n```\n\n### Running the container\n\nAfter building, run the container with your runtime secrets:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e DATABASE_URL=\"your-database-url\" \\\n  -e AUTH_SECRET=\"your-auth-secret\" \\\n  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=\"your-google-client-id\" \\\n  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your-google-client-secret\" \\\n  # ... other runtime environment variables\n  inbox-zero\n```\n\n**Important:** If you need to change `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, you must rebuild the Docker image. It cannot be changed at runtime.\n\nFor more detailed Docker build instructions and security considerations, see [docker/DOCKER_BUILD_GUIDE.md](docker/DOCKER_BUILD_GUIDE.md).\n\n\n### Calendar integrations\n\n*Note:* The calendar integration feature is a work in progress.\n\n#### Google Calendar\n\n1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library\n2. Search for \"Google Calendar API\"\n3. Click on it and then click \"Enable\"\n4. Visit: [credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):\n    1. Click on your project\n    2. In `Authorized redirect URIs` add:\n      - `http://localhost:3000/api/google/calendar/callback`\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\nYou can view open tasks in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/elie222/inbox-zero/issues).\nJoin our [Discord](https://www.getinboxzero.com/discord) to discuss tasks and check what's being worked on.\n\n[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) explains the architecture of the project (LLM generated).\n",

      "readme_content": "# Exa MCP Server 🔍\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/exa-mcp-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exa-mcp-server)\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/exa)](https://smithery.ai/server/exa)\n\n## 🆕 `exa-code`: fast, efficient web context for coding agents\n\nVibe coding should never have a bad vibe. `exa-code` is a huge step towards coding agents that never hallucinate.\n\nWhen your coding agent makes a search query, `exa-code` searches over billions\nof Github repos, docs pages, Stackoverflow posts, and more, to find the perfect, token-efficient context that the agent needs to code correctly. It's powered by the Exa search engine.\n\nExamples of queries you can make with `exa-code`:\n* use Exa search in python and make sure content is always livecrawled\n* use correct syntax for vercel ai sdk to call gpt-5 nano asking it how are you\n* how to set up a reproducible Nix Rust development environment\n\n**✨ Works with Cursor and Claude Code!** Use the HTTP-based configuration format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Remove-Me\": \"Disable web_search_exa tool if you're just coding. To 100% call exa-code, say 'use exa-code'.\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou may include your exa api key in the url like this:\n```\nhttps://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=YOUREXAKEY\n```\n\nYou may whitelist specific tools in the url with the `enabledTools` parameter which expects a url encoded array strings like this:\n```\nhttps://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=YOUREXAKEY&enabledTools=%5B%22crawling_exa%ss%5D\n```\n\nYou can also use `exa-code` through [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa) without an Exa API key.\n\n---\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Exa AI's search capabilities, including web search, research tools, and our new code search feature.\n\n## Remote Exa MCP 🌐\n\nConnect directly to Exa's hosted MCP server (instead of running it locally).\n\n### Remote Exa MCP URL\n\n```\nhttps://mcp.exa.ai/mcp\n```\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration for Remote MCP\n\nAdd this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cursor and Claude Code Configuration for Remote MCP\n\nFor Cursor and Claude Code, use this HTTP-based configuration format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### NPM Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g exa-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Using Claude Code\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add exa -e EXA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY -- npx -y exa-mcp-server\n```\n\n### Using Exa MCP through Smithery\n\nTo install the Exa MCP server via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa), head over to:\n\n[smithery.ai/server/exa](https://smithery.ai/server/exa)\n\n\n## Configuration ⚙️\n\n### 1. Configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Exa MCP server\n\nYou can find claude_desktop_config.json inside the settings of Claude Desktop app:\n\nOpen the Claude Desktop app and enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar. \n\nOnce enabled, open Settings (also from the top-left menu bar) and navigate to the Developer Option, where you'll find the Edit Config button. Clicking it will open the claude_desktop_config.json file, allowing you to make the necessary edits. \n\nOR (if you want to open claude_desktop_config.json from terminal)\n\n#### For macOS:\n\n1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n```bash\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n#### For Windows:\n\n1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n```powershell\ncode %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n### 2. Add the Exa server configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"exa-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"EXA_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).\n\n### 3. Available Tools & Tool Selection\n\nThe Exa MCP server includes powerful tools for developers and researchers:\n\n#### 🔥 **Featured: Code Search Tool**\n- **get_code_context_exa**: 🆕 **NEW!** Search and get relevant code snippets, examples, and documentation from open source libraries, GitHub repositories, and programming frameworks. Perfect for finding up-to-date code documentation, implementation examples, API usage patterns, and best practices from real codebases.\n\n#### 🌐 **Other Available Tools**\n- **web_search_exa**: Performs real-time web searches with optimized results and content extraction.\n- **company_research**: Comprehensive company research tool that crawls company websites to gather detailed information about businesses.\n- **crawling**: Extracts content from specific URLs, useful for reading articles, PDFs, or any web page when you have the exact URL.\n- **linkedin_search**: Search LinkedIn for companies and people using Exa AI. Simply include company names, person names, or specific LinkedIn URLs in your query.\n- **deep_researcher_start**: Start a smart AI researcher for complex questions. The AI will search the web, read many sources, and think deeply about your question to create a detailed research report.\n- **deep_researcher_check**: Check if your research is ready and get the results. Use this after starting a research task to see if it's done and get your comprehensive report.\n\nYou can choose which tools to enable by adding the `--tools` parameter to your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n#### 💻 **Setup for Code Search Only** (Recommended for Developers)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"exa-mcp-server\",\n        \"--tools=get_code_context_exa,web_search_exa\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"EXA_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Specify which tools to enable:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"exa-mcp-server\",\n        \"--tools=get_code_context_exa,web_search_exa,company_research,crawling,linkedin_search,deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"EXA_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor enabling multiple tools, use a comma-separated list:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"exa\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"exa-mcp-server\",\n        \"--tools=get_code_context_exa,web_search_exa,company_research,crawling,linkedin_search,deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"EXA_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't specify any tools, all tools enabled by default will be used.\n\n### 4. Restart Claude Desktop\n\nFor the changes to take effect:\n\n1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)\n2. Start Claude Desktop again\n3. Look for the icon to verify the Exa server is connected\n\n## Using via NPX\n\nIf you prefer to run the server directly, you can use npx:\n\n```bash\n# Run with all tools enabled by default\nnpx exa-mcp-server\n\n# Enable specific tools only\nnpx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search_exa\n\n# Enable multiple tools\nnpx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search_exa,get_code_context_exa\n\n# List all available tools\nnpx exa-mcp-server --list-tools\n```\n\n---\n\nBuilt with ❤️ by team Exa\n",

This gives AI agents, assistants, and chatbots the ability to read repositories and code files, manage issues and PRs, analyze code, and automate workflows. All through natural language interactions.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Repository Management: Browse and query code, search files, analyze commits, and understand project structure across any repository you have access to.\n- Issue & PR Automation: Create, update, and manage issues and pull requests. Let AI help triage bugs, review code changes, and maintain project boards.\n- CI/CD & Workflow Intelligence: Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs, analyze build failures, manage releases, and get insights into your development pipeline.\n- Code Analysis: Examine security findings, review Dependabot alerts, understand code patterns, and get comprehensive insights into your codebase.\n- Team Collaboration: Access discussions, manage notifications, analyze team activity, and streamline processes for your team.\n\nBuilt for developers who want to connect their AI tools to GitHub context and capabilities, from simple natural language queries to complex multi-step agent workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Remote GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D&quality=insiders)\n\nThe remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2.

Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.\n\n### Configuration\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](/docs/remote-server.md) on how to pass additional configuration settings to the remote GitHub MCP Server.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo \".env\" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n\n   # In config files (where supported)\n   \"env\": {\n     \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"$GITHUB_PAT\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n  - `read:org` - Organization team access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"github_token\",\n        \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\",\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n          \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"github_token\",\n      \"description\": \"GitHub Personal Access Token\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n        \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI\n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"github\": {\n        \"command\": \"/path/to/github-mcp-server\",\n        \"args\": [\"stdio\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available (all are on by default):\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |\n| `actions` | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations |\n| `code_security` | Code security related tools, such as GitHub Code Scanning |\n| `dependabot` | Dependabot tools |\n| `discussions` | GitHub Discussions related tools |\n| `experiments` | Experimental features that are not considered stable yet |\n| `gists` | GitHub Gist related tools |\n| `issues` | GitHub Issues related tools |\n| `notifications` | GitHub Notifications related tools |\n| `orgs` | GitHub Organization related tools |\n| `projects` | GitHub Projects related tools |\n| `pull_requests` | GitHub Pull Request related tools |\n| `repos` | GitHub Repository related tools |\n| `secret_protection` | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| `security_advisories` | Security advisories related tools |\n| `users` | GitHub User related tools |\n<!-- END AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n\n## Tools\n\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLS -->\n<details>\n\n<summary>Actions</summary>\n\n- **cancel_workflow_run** - Cancel workflow run\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **delete_workflow_run_logs** - Delete workflow logs\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **download_workflow_run_artifact** - Download workflow artifact\n  - `artifact_id`: The unique identifier of the artifact (number, required)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n\n- **get_job_logs** - Get job logs\n  - `failed_only`: When true, gets logs for all failed jobs in run_id (boolean, optional)\n  - `job_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow job (required for single job logs) (number, optional)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `return_content`: Returns actual log content instead of URLs (boolean, optional)\n  - `run_id`: Workflow run ID (required when using failed_only) (number, optional)\n  - `tail_lines`: Number of lines to return from the end of the log (number, optional)\n\n- **get_workflow_run** - Get workflow run\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **get_workflow_run_logs** - Get workflow run logs\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **get_workflow_run_usage** - Get workflow usage\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_jobs** - List workflow jobs\n  - `filter`: Filters jobs by their completed_at timestamp (string, optional)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `page`: Page number for pagination (min 1) (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page for pagination (min 1, max 100) (number, optional)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_run_artifacts** - List workflow artifacts\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `page`: Page number for pagination (min 1) (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page for pagination (min 1, max 100) (number, optional)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_runs** - List workflow runs\n  - `actor`: Returns someone's workflow runs.

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n\"github\": {\n    \"command\": \"docker\",\n    \"args\": [\n    \"run\",\n    \"-i\",\n    \"--rm\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\",\n    \"-e\",\n    \"GITHUB_HOST\",\n    \"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"${input:github_token}\",\n        \"GITHUB_HOST\": \"https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION\": \"an alternative description\",\n  \"TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION\": \"Create a new branch in a GitHub repository\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION=\"an alternative description\"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.

This document outlines the setup process and provides a basic example of using the client.\n\nIngest anything from Slack, Discord, websites, Google Drive, email, Jira, Linear or GitHub into a Graphlit project - and then search and retrieve relevant knowledge within an MCP client like Cursor, Windsurf, Goose or Cline.\n\nYour Graphlit project acts as a searchable, and RAG-ready knowledge base across all your developer and product management tools.\n\nDocuments (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.) and HTML web pages will be extracted to Markdown upon ingestion. Audio and video files will be transcribed upon ingestion.\n\nWeb crawling and web search are built-in as MCP tools, with no need to integrate other tools like Firecrawl, Exa, etc. separately.\n\nYou can read more about the MCP Server use cases and features on our [blog](https://www.graphlit.com/blog/graphlit-mcp-server).\n\nWatch our latest [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or-QqonvcAs&t=4s) on using the Graphlit MCP Server with the Goose MCP client.\n\nFor any questions on using the MCP Server, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ygFmfjy3Qx) community and post on the #mcp channel.\n\n<a href=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/fscrivteod\">\n  <img width=\"380\" height=\"200\"

This server provides a robust set of\ntools and capabilities that enable LLMs to read, manage, and operate Heroku Platform resources.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Direct interaction with Heroku Platform resources through LLM-driven tools\n- Secure and authenticated access to Heroku Platform APIs, leveraging the Heroku CLI\n- Natural language interface for Heroku Platform interactions\n\nNote: The Heroku Platform MCP Server is currently in early development. As we continue to enhance and refine the\nimplementation, the available functionality and tools may evolve. We welcome feedback and contributions to help shape\nthe future of this project.\n\n> **Note:** The [Heroku Platform MCP Server](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-mcp-server) requires the\n> Heroku CLI to be installed globally (v10.8.1+). Ensure you have the correct version by running `heroku --version`.\n\n## Configure the Heroku Platform MCP Server\n\nYou can configure Claude Desktop, Zed, Cursor, Windsurf, and other clients to work with the Heroku Platform MCP Server.\n\n### Configure the Heroku Platform MCP Server with `heroku mcp:start`\n\nUse `heroku mcp:start` to launch the Heroku Platform MCP Server. We recommend this method as it leverages your existing\nHeroku CLI authentication, so you don't need to set the\n[`HEROKU_API_KEY`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-mcp-server#authentication) environment variable. The\n`heroku mcp:start` command is available in Heroku CLI version 10.8.1 and later.\n\nThere are several benefits to configuring with `heroku mcp:start`:\n\n- No need to manage or expose your Heroku API key\n- Uses your current Heroku CLI authentication context\n- Works seamlessly with supported clients\n\n#### Example configuration for [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"heroku mcp:start\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context_servers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": {\n        \"path\": \"heroku\",\n        \"args\": [\"mcp:start\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"heroku mcp:start\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Windsurf](https://www.windsurf.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"heroku mcp:start\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Cline](https://cline.bot):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"heroku mcp:start\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"heroku\": {\n        \"type\": \"stdio\",\n        \"command\": \"heroku\",\n        \"args\": [\"mcp:start\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Trae](https://trae.ai):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"heroku mcp:start\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** When you use `heroku mcp:start`, the server authenticates using your current Heroku CLI session so you don't\n> need to set the `HEROKU_API_KEY` environment variable. We recommend you use `heroku mcp:start`, but if you prefer to\n> use an API key, you can use the alternate configuration below.\n\n### Configure the Heroku Platform MCP Server with `npx -y @heroku/mcp-server`\n\nYou can also launch the Heroku Platform MCP Server using the `npx -y @heroku/mcp-server` command. This method requires\nyou to set the [`HEROKU_API_KEY`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-mcp-server#authentication) environment\nvariable with your Heroku\n[authorization token](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/authentication#retrieving-the-api-token).\n\n#### Generating the `HEROKU_API_KEY`\n\nGenerate a Heroku authorization token with one of these methods:\n\n- Use the Heroku CLI command:\n\n  ```sh\n    heroku authorizations:create\n  ```\n\n- Use an existing token in the CLI\n\n  ```sh\n    heroku auth:token\n  ```\n\n  Copy the token and use it as your `HEROKU_API_KEY` in the following steps.\n\n- In your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/applications):\n  1. Select your avatar, then select **Account Settings**.\n  2. Open the Applications tab.\n  3. Next to **Authorizations**, click **Create authorization**.\n\n#### Example configuration for [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context_servers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": {\n        \"path\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx -y @heroku/mcp-server\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Windsurf](https://www.windsurf.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Cline](https://cline.bot):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"heroku\": {\n        \"type\": \"stdio\",\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example configuration for [Trae](https://trae.ai):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"heroku\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@heroku/mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HEROKU_API_KEY\": \"<YOUR_HEROKU_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** When you use `npx -y @heroku/mcp-server`, you must set the `HEROKU_API_KEY` environment variable with your\n> Heroku authorization token.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### Application Management\n\n- `list_apps` - List all Heroku apps.

      "readme_content": "# Make MCP Server (legacy)\n\n**A modern, cloud-based version of the Make MCP Server is now available. For most use cases, we recommend using [this new version](https://developers.make.com/mcp-server).**\n\nA Model Context Protocol server that enables Make scenarios to be utilized as tools by AI assistants. This integration allows AI systems to trigger and interact with your Make automation workflows.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe MCP server:\n\n-   Connects to your Make account and identifies all scenarios configured with \"On-Demand\" scheduling\n-   Parses and resolves input parameters for each scenario, providing AI assistants with meaningful parameter descriptions\n-   Allows AI assistants to invoke scenarios with appropriate parameters\n-   Returns scenario output as structured JSON, enabling AI assistants to properly interpret the results\n\n## Benefits\n\n-   Turn your Make scenarios into callable tools for AI assistants\n-   Maintain complex automation logic in Make while exposing functionality to AI systems\n-   Create bidirectional communication between your AI assistants and your existing automation workflows\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   NodeJS\n-   MCP Client (like Claude Desktop App)\n-   Make API Key with `scenarios:read` and `scenarios:run` scopes\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the \"mcpServers\" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"make\": {\n            \"command\": \"npx\",\n            \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@makehq/mcp-server\"],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"MAKE_API_KEY\": \"<your-api-key>\",\n                \"MAKE_ZONE\": \"<your-zone>\",\n                \"MAKE_TEAM\": \"<your-team-id>\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n-   `MAKE_API_KEY` - You can generate an API key in your Make profile.\n-   `MAKE_ZONE` - The zone your organization is hosted in (e.g., `eu2.make.com`).\n-   `MAKE_TEAM` - You can find the ID in the URL of the Team page.\n",

You interact with a machine by running **instructions**\n(Python statements and expressions) on it, and receiving the results. A machine processes one instruction\nat a time.\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nYou will need an API token (if you need one, reach out to [paul@jamsocket.com](mailto:paul@jamsocket.com)).\n\nThe easiest way to try out foreverVM is using the CLI. First, you will need to log in:\n\n```bash\nnpx forevervm login\n```\n\nOnce logged in, you can open a REPL interface with a new machine:\n\n```bash\nnpx forevervm repl\n```\n\nWhen foreverVM starts your machine, it gives it an ID that you can later use to reconnect to it. You can reconnect to a machine like this:\n\n```bash\nnpx forevervm repl [machine_name]\n```\n\nYou can list your machines (in reverse order of creation) like this:\n\n```bash\nnpx forevervm machine list\n```\n\nYou don't need to terminate machines -- foreverVM will automatically swap them from memory to disk when they are idle, and then\nautomatically swap them back when needed. This is what allows foreverVM to run repls “forever”.\n\nUsing the API\n-------------\n\n```typescript\nimport { ForeverVM } from '@forevervm/sdk'\n\nconst token = process.env.FOREVERVM_TOKEN\nif (!token) {\n  throw new Error('FOREVERVM_TOKEN is not set')\n}\n\n// Initialize foreverVM\nconst fvm = new ForeverVM({ token })\n\n// Connect to a new machine.\nconst repl = fvm.repl()\n\n// Execute some code\nlet execResult = repl.exec('4 + 4')\n\n// Get the result\nconsole.log('result:', await execResult.result)\n\n// We can also print stdout and stderr\nexecResult = repl.exec('for i in range(10):\\n  print(i)')\n\nfor await (const output of execResult.output) {\n  console.log(output.stream, output.data)\n}\n\nprocess.exit(0)\n```\n\nWorking with Tags\n----------------\n\nYou can create machines with tags and filter machines by tags:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ForeverVM } from '@forevervm/sdk'\n\nconst fvm = new ForeverVM({ token: process.env.FOREVERVM_TOKEN })\n\n// Create a machine with tags\nconst machineResponse = await fvm.createMachine({\n  tags: { \n    env: 'production', \n    owner: 'user123',\n    project: 'demo'\n  }\n})\n\n// List machines filtered by tags\nconst productionMachines = await fvm.listMachines({\n  tags: { env: 'production' }\n})\n```\n\nMemory Limits\n----------------\n\nYou can create machines with memory limits by specifying the memory size in megabytes:\n\n```typescript\n// Create a machine with 512MB memory limit\nconst machineResponse = await fvm.createMachine({\n  memory_mb: 512,\n})\n```\n",

No need to fiddle with JSON or API token anymore.\n> - Powerful tools tailored to AI agents. These tools are designed with optimized token consumption in mind.\n> \n> Learn more and try it out [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp)\n\n\n![notion-mcp-sm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c07003c-8455-4636-b298-d60ffdf46cd8)\n\nThis project implements an [MCP server](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro). \n\n![mcp-demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ff90a7-7801-48a9-b807-f7dd47f0d3d6)\n\n### Installation\n\n#### 1. Setting up Integration in Notion:\nGo to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new **internal** integration or select an existing one.\n\n![Creating a Notion Integration token](docs/images/integrations-creation.png)\n\nWhile we limit the scope of Notion API's exposed (for example, you will not be able to delete databases via MCP), there is a non-zero risk to workspace data by exposing it to LLMs. Security-conscious users may want to further configure the Integration's _Capabilities_. \n\nFor example, you can create a read-only integration token by giving only \"Read content\" access from the \"Configuration\" tab:\n\n![Notion Integration Token Capabilities showing Read content checked](docs/images/integrations-capabilities.png)\n\n#### 2. Connecting content to integration:\nEnsure relevant pages and databases are connected to your integration.\n\nTo do this, visit the **Access** tab in your internal integration settings. Edit access and select the pages you'd like to use.\n![Integration Access tab](docs/images/integration-access.png)\n\n![Edit integration access](docs/images/page-access-edit.png)\n\nAlternatively, you can grant page access individually. You'll need to visit the target page, and click on the 3 dots, and select \"Connect to integration\". \n\n![Adding Integration Token to Notion Connections](docs/images/connections.png)\n\n#### 3. Adding MCP config to your client:\n\n##### Using npm:\n\n**Cursor & Claude:**\n\nAdd the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json` (MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)\n\n**Option 1: Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended)**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@notionhq/notion-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NOTION_TOKEN\": \"ntn_****\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Option 2: Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases)**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@notionhq/notion-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS\": \"{\\\"Authorization\\\": \\\"Bearer ntn_****\\\", \\\"Notion-Version\\\": \\\"2022-06-28\\\" }\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Zed**\n\nAdd the following to your `settings.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context_servers\": {\n    \"some-context-server\": {\n      \"command\": {\n        \"path\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@notionhq/notion-mcp-server\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS\": \"{\\\"Authorization\\\": \\\"Bearer ntn_****\\\", \\\"Notion-Version\\\": \\\"2022-06-28\\\" }\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"settings\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n##### Using Docker:\n\nThere are two options for running the MCP server with Docker:\n\n###### Option 1: Using the official Docker Hub image:\n\nAdd the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n**Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended):**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"-e\", \"NOTION_TOKEN\",\n        \"mcp/notion\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NOTION_TOKEN\": \"ntn_****\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases):**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"-e\", \"OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS\",\n        \"mcp/notion\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS\": \"{\\\"Authorization\\\":\\\"Bearer ntn_****\\\",\\\"Notion-Version\\\":\\\"2022-06-28\\\"}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Uses the official Docker Hub image\n- Properly handles JSON escaping via environment variables\n- Provides a more reliable configuration method\n\n###### Option 2: Building the Docker image locally:\n\nYou can also build and run the Docker image locally. First, build the Docker image:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose build\n```\n\nThen, add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n**Using NOTION_TOKEN (recommended):**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_****\",\n        \"notion-mcp-server\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Using OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS (for advanced use cases):**\n```javascript\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"notionApi\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS={\\\"Authorization\\\": \\\"Bearer ntn_****\\\", \\\"Notion-Version\\\": \\\"2022-06-28\\\"}\",\n        \"notion-mcp-server\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDon't forget to replace `ntn_****` with your integration secret. Find it from your integration configuration tab:\n\n![Copying your Integration token from the Configuration tab in the developer portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b44536-5333-49fa-809c-59581bf5370a)\n\n\n#### Installing via Smithery\n\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server)\n\nTo install Notion API Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@makenotion/notion-mcp-server):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @makenotion/notion-mcp-server --client claude\n```\n\n### Transport Options\n\nThe Notion MCP Server supports two transport modes:\n\n#### STDIO Transport (Default)\nThe default transport mode uses standard input/output for communication. This is the standard MCP transport used by most clients like Claude Desktop.\n\n```bash\n# Run with default stdio transport\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server\n\n# Or explicitly specify stdio\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport stdio\n```\n\n#### Streamable HTTP Transport\nFor web-based applications or clients that prefer HTTP communication, you can use the Streamable HTTP transport:\n\n```bash\n# Run with Streamable HTTP transport on port 3000 (default)\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http\n\n# Run on a custom port\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --port 8080\n\n# Run with a custom authentication token\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --auth-token \"your-secret-token\"\n```\n\nWhen using Streamable HTTP transport, the server will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:<port>/mcp`.\n\n##### Authentication\nThe Streamable HTTP transport requires bearer token authentication for security. You have three options:\n\n**Option 1: Auto-generated token (recommended for development)**\n```bash\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http\n```\nThe server will generate a secure random token and display it in the console:\n```\nGenerated auth token: a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab\nUse this token in the Authorization header: Bearer a1b2c3d4e5f6789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab\n```\n\n**Option 2: Custom token via command line (recommended for production)**\n```bash\nnpx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http --auth-token \"your-secret-token\"\n```\n\n**Option 3: Custom token via environment variable (recommended for production)**\n```bash\nAUTH_TOKEN=\"your-secret-token\" npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --transport http\n```\n\nThe command line argument `--auth-token` takes precedence over the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable if both are provided.\n\n##### Making HTTP Requests\nAll requests to the Streamable HTTP transport must include the bearer token in the Authorization header:\n\n```bash\n# Example request\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer your-token-here\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -H \"mcp-session-id: your-session-id\" \\\n     -d '{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"initialize\", \"params\": {}, \"id\": 1}' \\\n     http://localhost:3000/mcp\n```\n\n**Note:** Make sure to set either the `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended) or the `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` environment variable with your Notion integration token when using either transport mode.\n\n### Examples\n\n1. Using the following instruction\n```\nComment \"Hello MCP\" on page \"Getting started\"\n```\n\nAI will correctly plan two API calls, `v1/search` and `v1/comments`, to achieve the task\n\n2. Similarly, the following instruction will result in a new page named \"Notion MCP\" added to parent page \"Development\"\n```\nAdd a page titled \"Notion MCP\" to page \"Development\"\n```\n\n3. You may also reference content ID directly\n```\nGet the content of page 1a6b35e6e67f802fa7e1d27686f017f2\n```\n\n### Development\n\nBuild\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nExecute\n\n```\nnpx -y --prefix /path/to/local/notion-mcp-server @notionhq/notion-mcp-server\n```\n\nPublish\n\n```\nnpm publish --access public\n```\n",

This MCP Server allows you to interact with your Kubernetes cluster via the Claude Desktop App!\n\n## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)? \nYou can read more about the Model Context Protocol here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io\n\nBut in a nutshell\n> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.\n\n## What is Metoro?\n[Metoro](https://metoro.io/) is an observability platform designed for microservices running in Kubernetes and uses eBPF based instrumentation to generate deep telemetry without code changes.\nThe data that is generated by the eBPF agents is sent to Metoro's backend to be stored and in the Metoro frontend using our apis.\n\nThis MCP server exposes those APIs to an LLM so you can ask your AI questions about your Kubernetes cluster.\n\n## Demo\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f21e9a-45b8-4c17-8d8c-cff560d8694f\n\n## How can I use Metoro MCP Server? \n1. Install the [Claude Desktop App](https://claude.ai/download).\n2. Make sure you have [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) installed. `brew install go` for mac or `sudo apt-get install golang` for ubuntu.\n3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/metoro-io/metoro-mcp-server.git`\n4. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd metoro-mcp-server`\n5. Build the server executable: `go build -o metoro-mcp-server`\n\n### If you already have a Metoro Account:\nCopy your auth token from your Metoro account in [Settings](https://us-east.metoro.io/settings) -> Users Settings. \nCreate a file in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` with the following contents:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"metoro-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"<your path to Metoro MCP server go executable>/metoro-mcp-server\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"env\": {\n          \"METORO_AUTH_TOKEN\" : \"<your auth token>\",\n          \"METORO_API_URL\": \"https://us-east.metoro.io\"\n       }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### If you don't have a Metoro Account:\nNo worries, you can still play around using the [Live Demo Cluster](https://demo.us-east.metoro.io/).\nThe included token is a demo token, publicly available for anyone to use.\n   Create a file in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` with the following contents:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"metoro-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"<your path to Metoro MCP server go executable>/metoro-mcp-server\",\n      \"args\": [],\n      \"env\": {\n          \"METORO_AUTH_TOKEN\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjdXN0b21lcklkIjoiOThlZDU1M2QtYzY4ZC00MDRhLWFhZjItNDM2ODllNWJiMGUzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0QGNocmlzYmF0dGFyYmVlLmNvbSIsImV4cCI6MTgyMTI0NzIzN30.7G6alDpcZh_OThYj293Jce5rjeOBqAhOlANR_Fl5auw\",\n          \"METORO_API_URL\": \"https://demo.us-east.metoro.io\"\n       }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Once you are done editing `claude_desktop_config.json` save the file and restart Claude Desktop app.\n5. You should now see the Metoro MCP Server in the dropdown list of MCP Servers in the Claude Desktop App. You are ready to start using Metoro MCP Server with Claude Desktop App!\n\n## Built with\n\nThis server is built on top of our [Golang MCP SDK](https://github.com/metoro-io/mcp-golang).\n",

Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,\nthe session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state\nto the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage\nstate [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).\n\n```js\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\",\n        \"--isolated\",\n        \"--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Browser Extension**\n\nThe Playwright MCP Chrome Extension allows you to connect to existing browser tabs and leverage your logged-in sessions and browser state. See [extension/README.md](extension/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.\n\n### Configuration file\n\nThe Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file\nusing the `--config` command line option:\n\n```bash\nnpx @playwright/mcp@latest --config path/to/config.json\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Configuration file schema</summary>\n\n```typescript\n{\n  // Browser configuration\n  browser?: {\n    // Browser type to use (chromium, firefox, or webkit)\n    browserName?: 'chromium' | 'firefox' | 'webkit';\n\n    // Keep the browser profile in memory, do not save it to disk.\n    isolated?: boolean;\n\n    // Path to user data directory for browser profile persistence\n    userDataDir?: string;\n\n    // Browser launch options (see Playwright docs)\n    // @see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch\n    launchOptions?: {\n      channel?: string;        // Browser channel (e.g. 'chrome')\n      headless?: boolean;      // Run in headless mode\n      executablePath?: string; // Path to browser executable\n      // ... other Playwright launch options\n    };\n\n    // Browser context options\n    // @see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context\n    contextOptions?: {\n      viewport?: { width: number, height: number };\n      // ... other Playwright context options\n    };\n\n    // CDP endpoint for connecting to existing browser\n    cdpEndpoint?: string;\n\n    // Remote Playwright server endpoint\n    remoteEndpoint?: string;\n  },\n\n  // Server configuration\n  server?: {\n    port?: number;  // Port to listen on\n    host?: string;  // Host to bind to (default: localhost)\n  },\n\n  // List of additional capabilities\n  capabilities?: Array<\n    'tabs' |    // Tab management\n    'install' | // Browser installation\n    'pdf' |     // PDF generation\n    'vision' |  // Coordinate-based interactions\n  >;\n\n  // Directory for output files\n  outputDir?: string;\n\n  // Network configuration\n  network?: {\n    // List of origins to allow the browser to request.

You can use Needle MCP Server to easily enable semantic search tools in your AI applications, making data buried in PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, and other files instantly accessible by LLMs.\n\n**We recommend using our remote MCP server** for the best experience - no local setup required.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n- **Document Management:** Easily add and organize documents on the server.\n- **Search & Retrieval:** Claude-based natural language search for quick answers.\n- **Easy Integration:** Works with [Claude Desktop](#commands-in-claude-desktop) and Needle collections.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Commands in Claude Desktop\n\nBelow is an example of how the commands can be used in Claude Desktop to interact with the server:\n\n![Using commands in Claude Desktop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0ce522-6675-46d9-9bfb-3162d214625b)\n\n1. **Open Claude Desktop** and connect to the Needle MCP Server.  \n2. **Use simple text commands** to search, retrieve, or modify documents.  \n3. **Review search results** returned by Claude in a user-friendly interface.\n\n### Result in Needle\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0235e893-af96-4920-8364-1e86f73b3e6c\n\n---\n\n## Youtube Video Explanation\n\nFor a full walkthrough on using the Needle MCP Server with Claude and Claude Desktop, watch this [YouTube explanation video](https://youtu.be/nVrRYp9NZYg).\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### 1. Remote MCP Server (Recommended)\n\n**Claude Desktop Config**\n\nCreate or update your config file:\n- For MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- For Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://mcp.needle.app/mcp\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization:Bearer ${NEEDLE_API_KEY}\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_API_KEY\": \"<your-needle-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Cursor Config**\n\nCreate or update `.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://mcp.needle.app/mcp\",\n        \"--header\",\n        \"Authorization:${NEEDLE_AUTH_HEADER}\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_AUTH_HEADER\": \"Bearer <your-needle-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nGet your API key from [Needle Settings](https://needle.app).\n\nWe provide two endpoints:\n- **Streamable HTTP**: `https://mcp.needle.app/mcp` (recommended)\n- **SSE**: `https://mcp.needle.app/sse`\n\nNote: MCP deprecated SSE endpoints in the latest specification, so newer clients should prefer the Streamable HTTP endpoint.\n\n### 2. Local Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/needle-ai/needle-mcp.git\n```\n\n2. Install UV globally using Homebrew:\n```bash\nbrew install uv\n```\n\n3. Create your config file:\n   - For MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - For Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n**Claude Desktop Config**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\"--directory\", \"/path/to/needle-mcp\", \"run\", \"needle-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_API_KEY\": \"<your-needle-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Cursor Config**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\"--directory\", \"/path/to/needle-mcp\", \"run\", \"needle-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_API_KEY\": \"<your-needle-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Replace `/path/to/needle-mcp` with your actual repository path\n5. Add your Needle API key\n6. Restart Claude Desktop\n\n**Installing via Smithery**\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install needle-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n### 3. Docker Installation\n\n1. Clone and build:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/needle-ai/needle-mcp.git\ncd needle-mcp\ndocker build -t needle-mcp .\n```\n\n2. Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"--rm\", \"-i\", \"needle-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_API_KEY\": \"<your-needle-api-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Restart Claude Desktop\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n* \"Create a new collection called 'Technical Docs'\"\n* \"Add this document to the collection, which is https://needle.app\"\n* \"Search the collection for information about AI\"\n* \"List all my collections\"\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf not working:\n- Make sure `uv` is installed globally (if not, uninstall with `pip uninstall uv` and reinstall with `brew install uv`)\n- Or find `uv` path with `which uv` and replace `\"command\": \"uv\"` with the full path\n- Verify your Needle API key is correct\n- Check if the needle-mcp path in config matches your actual repository location\n\n### Reset Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nIf you're seeing old configurations or the integration isn't working:\n\n1. Find all Claude Desktop config files:\n```bash\nfind / -name \"claude_desktop_config.json\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n2. Remove all Claude Desktop data:\n- On MacOS: `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/*`\n- On Windows: Delete contents of `%APPDATA%/Claude/`\n\n3. Create a fresh config with only Needle:\n```\nmkdir -p ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude\ncat > ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n<< 'EOL'\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"needle\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/path/to/needle-mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"needle-mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NEEDLE_API_KEY\": \"your_needle_api_key\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nEOL\n```\n\n4. Completely quit Claude Desktop (Command+Q on Mac) and relaunch it\n\n5. If you still see old configurations:\n- Check for additional config files in other locations\n- Try clearing browser cache if using web version\n- Verify the config file is being read from the correct location\n",

Maximum allowed value is 7 days.\n\n* `arbitrary_query` - Run an arbitrary query on the Pydantic Logfire database.\n  * Arguments:\n    * `query` (string) - The query to run, as a SQL string.\n    * `age` (integer) - Number of minutes to look back, e.g. 30 for last 30 minutes. Maximum allowed value is 7 days.\n\n* `logfire_link` - Creates a link to help the user to view the trace in the Logfire UI.\n  * Arguments:\n    * `trace_id` (string) - The trace ID to link to.\n\n* `schema_reference` - The database schema for the Logfire DataFusion database.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n### Install `uv`\n\nThe first thing to do is make sure `uv` is installed, as `uv` is used to run the MCP server.\n\nFor installation instructions, see the [`uv` installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\n\nIf you already have an older version of `uv` installed, you might need to update it with `uv self update`.\n\n### Obtain a Pydantic Logfire read token\nIn order to make requests to the Pydantic Logfire APIs, the Pydantic Logfire MCP server requires a \"read token\".\n\nYou can create one under the \"Read Tokens\" section of your project settings in Pydantic Logfire:\nhttps://logfire.pydantic.dev/-/redirect/latest-project/settings/read-tokens\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Pydantic Logfire read tokens are project-specific, so you need to create one for the specific project you want to expose to the Pydantic Logfire MCP server.\n\n### Manually run the server\n\nOnce you have `uv` installed and have a Pydantic Logfire read token, you can manually run the MCP server using `uvx` (which is provided by `uv`).\n\nYou can specify your read token using the `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nLOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN=YOUR_READ_TOKEN uvx logfire-mcp@latest\n```\n\nYou can also set `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN` in a `.env` file:\n\n```bash\nLOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN=pylf_v1_us_...\n```\n\n**NOTE:** for this to work, the MCP server needs to run with the directory containing the `.env` file in its working directory.\n\nor using the `--read-token` flag:\n\n```bash\nuvx logfire-mcp@latest --read-token=YOUR_READ_TOKEN\n```\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are using Cursor, Claude Desktop, Cline, or other MCP clients that manage your MCP servers for you, you **_do\n    NOT_** need to manually run the server yourself. The next section will show you how to configure these clients to make\n    use of the Pydantic Logfire MCP server.\n\n### Base URL\n\nIf you are running Logfire in a self hosted environment, you need to specify the base URL.\nThis can be done using the `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nLOGFIRE_BASE_URL=https://logfire.my-company.com uvx logfire-mcp@latest --read-token=YOUR_READ_TOKEN\n```\n\nYou can also use the `--base-url` argument:\n\n```bash\nuvx logfire-mcp@latest --base-url=https://logfire.my-company.com --read-token=YOUR_READ_TOKEN\n```\n\n## Configuration with well-known MCP clients\n\n### Configure for Cursor\n\nCreate a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"logfire\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"logfire-mcp@latest\", \"--read-token=YOUR-TOKEN\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe Cursor doesn't accept the `env` field, so you need to use the `--read-token` flag instead.\n\n### Configure for Claude code\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add logfire -e LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN -- uvx logfire-mcp@latest\n```\n\n### Configure for Claude Desktop\n\nAdd to your Claude settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": [\"uvx\"],\n  \"args\": [\"logfire-mcp@latest\"],\n  \"type\": \"stdio\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure for Cline\n\nAdd to your Cline settings in `cline_mcp_settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"logfire\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"logfire-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN\"\n      },\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"autoApprove\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure for VS Code\n\nMake sure you [enabled MCP support in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_enable-mcp-support-in-vs-code).\n\nCreate a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"logfire\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"uvx\", // or the absolute /path/to/uvx\n      \"args\": [\"logfire-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configure for Zed\n\nCreate a `.zed/settings.json` file in your project's root directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context_servers\": {\n    \"logfire\": {\n      \"source\": \"custom\",\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"logfire-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN\"\n      },\n      \"enabled\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Example Interactions\n\n1. Get details about exceptions from traces in a specific file:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"find_exceptions_in_file\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"filepath\": \"app/api.py\",\n    \"age\": 1440\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResponse:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"created_at\": \"2024-03-20T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"message\": \"Failed to process request\",\n    \"exception_type\": \"ValueError\",\n    \"exception_message\": \"Invalid input format\",\n    \"function_name\": \"process_request\",\n    \"line_number\": \"42\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"service.name\": \"api-service\",\n      \"code.filepath\": \"app/api.py\"\n    },\n    \"trace_id\": \"1234567890abcdef\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n2. Run a custom query on traces:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"arbitrary_query\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"query\": \"SELECT trace_id, message, created_at, attributes->>'service.name' as service FROM records WHERE severity_text = 'ERROR' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10\",\n    \"age\": 1440\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Examples of Questions for Claude\n\n1. \"What exceptions occurred in traces from the last hour across all services?\"\n2. \"Show me the recent errors in the file 'app/api.py' with their trace context\"\n3. \"How many errors were there in the last 24 hours per service?\"\n4. \"What are the most common exception types in my traces, grouped by service name?\"\n5. \"Get me the OpenTelemetry schema for traces and metrics\"\n6. \"Find all errors from yesterday and show their trace contexts\"\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. First, obtain a Pydantic Logfire read token from:\n   https://logfire.pydantic.dev/-/redirect/latest-project/settings/read-tokens\n\n2. Run the MCP server:\n   ```bash\n   uvx logfire-mcp@latest --read-token=YOUR_TOKEN\n   ```\n\n3. Configure your preferred client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, or Cline) using the configuration examples above\n\n4. Start using the MCP server to analyze your OpenTelemetry traces and metrics!\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to help improve the Pydantic Logfire MCP server. Whether you want to add new trace analysis tools, enhance metrics querying functionality, or improve documentation, your input is valuable.\n\nFor examples of other MCP servers and implementation patterns, see the [Model Context Protocol servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).\n\n## License\n\nPydantic Logfire MCP is licensed under the MIT License.

This field is required if there are no default collection name.\n                                   If there is a default collection name, this field is not enabled.\n   - Returns: Information stored in the Qdrant database as separate messages\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThe configuration of the server is done using environment variables:\n\n| Name                     | Description                                                         | Default Value                                                     |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `QDRANT_URL`             | URL of the Qdrant server                                            | None                                                              |\n| `QDRANT_API_KEY`         | API key for the Qdrant server                                       | None                                                              |\n| `COLLECTION_NAME`        | Name of the default collection to use.                              | None                                                              |\n| `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH`      | Path to the local Qdrant database (alternative to `QDRANT_URL`)     | None                                                              |\n| `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`     | Embedding provider to use (currently only \"fastembed\" is supported) | `fastembed`                                                       |\n| `EMBEDDING_MODEL`        | Name of the embedding model to use                                  | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`                          |\n| `TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION` | Custom description for the store tool                               | See default in [`settings.py`](src/mcp_server_qdrant/settings.py) |\n| `TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION`  | Custom description for the find tool                                | See default in [`settings.py`](src/mcp_server_qdrant/settings.py) |\n\nNote: You cannot provide both `QDRANT_URL` and `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH` at the same time.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Command-line arguments are not supported anymore! Please use environment variables for all configuration.\n\n### FastMCP Environment Variables\n\nSince `mcp-server-qdrant` is based on FastMCP, it also supports all the FastMCP environment variables. The most\nimportant ones are listed below:\n\n| Environment Variable                  | Description                                               | Default Value |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| `FASTMCP_DEBUG`                       | Enable debug mode                                         | `false`       |\n| `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`                   | Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) | `INFO`        |\n| `FASTMCP_HOST`                        | Host address to bind the server to                        | `127.0.0.1`   |\n| `FASTMCP_PORT`                        | Port to run the server on                                 | `8000`        |\n| `FASTMCP_WARN_ON_DUPLICATE_RESOURCES` | Show warnings for duplicate resources                     | `true`        |\n| `FASTMCP_WARN_ON_DUPLICATE_TOOLS`     | Show warnings for duplicate tools                         | `true`        |\n| `FASTMCP_WARN_ON_DUPLICATE_PROMPTS`   | Show warnings for duplicate prompts                       | `true`        |\n| `FASTMCP_DEPENDENCIES`                | List of dependencies to install in the server environment | `[]`          |\n\n## Installation\n\n### Using uvx\n\nWhen using [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) no specific installation is needed to directly run *mcp-server-qdrant*.\n\n```shell\nQDRANT_URL=\"http://localhost:6333\" \\\nCOLLECTION_NAME=\"my-collection\" \\\nEMBEDDING_MODEL=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" \\\nuvx mcp-server-qdrant\n```\n\n#### Transport Protocols\n\nThe server supports different transport protocols that can be specified using the `--transport` flag:\n\n```shell\nQDRANT_URL=\"http://localhost:6333\" \\\nCOLLECTION_NAME=\"my-collection\" \\\nuvx mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse\n```\n\nSupported transport protocols:\n\n- `stdio` (default): Standard input/output transport, might only be used by local MCP clients\n- `sse`: Server-Sent Events transport, perfect for remote clients\n- `streamable-http`: Streamable HTTP transport, perfect for remote clients, more recent than SSE\n\nThe default transport is `stdio` if not specified.\n\nWhen SSE transport is used, the server will listen on the specified port and wait for incoming connections. The default\nport is 8000, however it can be changed using the `FASTMCP_PORT` environment variable.\n\n```shell\nQDRANT_URL=\"http://localhost:6333\" \\\nCOLLECTION_NAME=\"my-collection\" \\\nFASTMCP_PORT=1234 \\\nuvx mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse\n```\n\n### Using Docker\n\nA Dockerfile is available for building and running the MCP server:\n\n```bash\n# Build the container\ndocker build -t mcp-server-qdrant .\n\n# Run the container\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 \\\n  -e FASTMCP_HOST=\"0.0.0.0\" \\\n  -e QDRANT_URL=\"http://your-qdrant-server:6333\" \\\n  -e QDRANT_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\" \\\n  -e COLLECTION_NAME=\"your-collection\" \\\n  mcp-server-qdrant\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Please note that we set `FASTMCP_HOST=\"0.0.0.0\"` to make the server listen on all network interfaces. This is\n> necessary when running the server in a Docker container.\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Qdrant MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/protocol/mcp-server-qdrant):\n\n```bash\nnpx @smithery/cli install mcp-server-qdrant --client claude\n```\n\n### Manual configuration of Claude Desktop\n\nTo use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the \"mcpServers\" section of your\n`claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"qdrant\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\"mcp-server-qdrant\"],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"QDRANT_URL\": \"https://xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333\",\n      \"QDRANT_API_KEY\": \"your_api_key\",\n      \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"your-collection-name\",\n      \"EMBEDDING_MODEL\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor local Qdrant mode:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"qdrant\": {\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\"mcp-server-qdrant\"],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH\": \"/path/to/qdrant/database\",\n      \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"your-collection-name\",\n      \"EMBEDDING_MODEL\": \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis MCP server will automatically create a collection with the specified name if it doesn't exist.\n\nBy default, the server will use the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model to encode memories.\nFor the time being, only [FastEmbed](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/) models are supported.\n\n## Support for other tools\n\nThis MCP server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For example, you can use it with\n[Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), which provide built-in support for the Model Context\nProtocol.\n\n### Using with Cursor/Windsurf\n\nYou can configure this MCP server to work as a code search tool for Cursor or Windsurf by customizing the tool\ndescriptions:\n\n```bash\nQDRANT_URL=\"http://localhost:6333\" \\\nCOLLECTION_NAME=\"code-snippets\" \\\nTOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION=\"Store reusable code snippets for later retrieval. \\\nThe 'information' parameter should contain a natural language description of what the code does, \\\nwhile the actual code should be included in the 'metadata' parameter as a 'code' property. \\\nThe value of 'metadata' is a Python dictionary with strings as keys. \\\nUse this whenever you generate some code snippet.\" \\\nTOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION=\"Search for relevant code snippets based on natural language descriptions. \\\nThe 'query' parameter should describe what you're looking for, \\\nand the tool will return the most relevant code snippets. \\\nUse this when you need to find existing code snippets for reuse or reference.\" \\\nuvx mcp-server-qdrant --transport sse # Enable SSE transport\n```\n\nIn Cursor/Windsurf, you can then configure the MCP server in your settings by pointing to this running server using\nSSE transport protocol. The description on how to add an MCP server to Cursor can be found in the [Cursor\ndocumentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#adding-an-mcp-server-to-cursor). If you are\nrunning Cursor/Windsurf locally, you can use the following URL:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/sse\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> We suggest SSE transport as a preferred way to connect Cursor/Windsurf to the MCP server, as it can support remote\n> connections. That makes it easy to share the server with your team or use it in a cloud environment.\n\nThis configuration transforms the Qdrant MCP server into a specialized code search tool that can:\n\n1. Store code snippets, documentation, and implementation details\n2. Retrieve relevant code examples based on semantic search\n3. Help developers find specific implementations or usage patterns\n\nYou can populate the database by storing natural language descriptions of code snippets (in the `information` parameter)\nalong with the actual code (in the `metadata.code` property), and then search for them using natural language queries\nthat describe what you're looking for.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The tool descriptions provided above are examples and may need to be customized for your specific use case. Consider\n> adjusting the descriptions to better match your team's workflow and the specific types of code snippets you want to\n> store and retrieve.\n\n**If you have successfully installed the `mcp-server-qdrant`, but still can't get it to work with Cursor, please\nconsider creating the [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) so the MCP tools are always used when\nthe agent produces a new code snippet.** You can restrict the rules to only work for certain file types, to avoid using\nthe MCP server for the documentation or other types of content.\n\n### Using with Claude Code\n\nYou can enhance Claude Code's capabilities by connecting it to this MCP server, enabling semantic search over your\nexisting codebase.\n\n#### Setting up mcp-server-qdrant\n\n1. Add the MCP server to Claude Code:\n\n    ```shell\n    # Add mcp-server-qdrant configured for code search\n    claude mcp add code-search \\\n    -e QDRANT_URL=\"http://localhost:6333\" \\\n    -e COLLECTION_NAME=\"code-repository\" \\\n    -e EMBEDDING_MODEL=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" \\\n    -e TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION=\"Store code snippets with descriptions. The 'information' parameter should contain a natural language description of what the code does, while the actual code should be included in the 'metadata' parameter as a 'code' property.\" \\\n    -e TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION=\"Search for relevant code snippets using natural language. The 'query' parameter should describe the functionality you're looking for.\" \\\n    -- uvx mcp-server-qdrant\n    ```\n\n2. Verify the server was added:\n\n    ```shell\n    claude mcp list\n    ```\n\n#### Using Semantic Code Search in Claude Code\n\nTool descriptions, specified in `TOOL_STORE_DESCRIPTION` and `TOOL_FIND_DESCRIPTION`, guide Claude Code on how to use\nthe MCP server. The ones provided above are examples and may need to be customized for your specific use case. However,\nClaude Code should be already able to:\n\n1. Use the `qdrant-store` tool to store code snippets with descriptions.\n2. Use the `qdrant-find` tool to search for relevant code snippets using natural language.\n\n### Run MCP server in Development Mode\n\nThe MCP server can be run in development mode using the `mcp dev` command. This will start the server and open the MCP\ninspector in your browser.\n\n```shell\nCOLLECTION_NAME=mcp-dev fastmcp dev src/mcp_server_qdrant/server.py\n```\n\n### Using with VS Code\n\nFor one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below:\n\n[![Install with UVX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-UVX-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=qdrant&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22mcp-server-qdrant%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22QDRANT_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantUrl%7D%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantApiKey%7D%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AcollectionName%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantUrl%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+URL%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantApiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22collectionName%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Collection+Name%22%7D%5D) [![Install with UVX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-UVX-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=qdrant&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22mcp-server-qdrant%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22QDRANT_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantUrl%7D%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantApiKey%7D%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AcollectionName%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantUrl%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+URL%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantApiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22collectionName%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Collection+Name%22%7D%5D&quality=insiders)\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Docker-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=qdrant&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-p%22%2C%228000%3A8000%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22QDRANT_URL%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%2C%22mcp-server-qdrant%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22QDRANT_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantUrl%7D%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantApiKey%7D%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AcollectionName%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantUrl%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+URL%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantApiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22collectionName%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Collection+Name%22%7D%5D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Docker-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=qdrant&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-p%22%2C%228000%3A8000%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22QDRANT_URL%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%2C%22mcp-server-qdrant%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22QDRANT_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantUrl%7D%22%2C%22QDRANT_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AqdrantApiKey%7D%22%2C%22COLLECTION_NAME%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3AcollectionName%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantUrl%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+URL%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22qdrantApiKey%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Qdrant+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22collectionName%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Collection+Name%22%7D%5D&quality=insiders)\n\n#### Manual Installation\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"qdrantUrl\",\n        \"description\": \"Qdrant URL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"qdrantApiKey\",\n        \"description\": \"Qdrant API Key\",\n        \"password\": true\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"collectionName\",\n        \"description\": \"Collection Name\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"qdrant\": {\n        \"command\": \"uvx\",\n        \"args\": [\"mcp-server-qdrant\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"QDRANT_URL\": \"${input:qdrantUrl}\",\n          \"QDRANT_API_KEY\": \"${input:qdrantApiKey}\",\n          \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"${input:collectionName}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr if you prefer using Docker, add this configuration instead:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"qdrantUrl\",\n        \"description\": \"Qdrant URL\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"qdrantApiKey\",\n        \"description\": \"Qdrant API Key\",\n        \"password\": true\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"collectionName\",\n        \"description\": \"Collection Name\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"qdrant\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"-p\", \"8000:8000\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-e\", \"QDRANT_URL\",\n          \"-e\", \"QDRANT_API_KEY\",\n          \"-e\", \"COLLECTION_NAME\",\n          \"mcp-server-qdrant\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"QDRANT_URL\": \"${input:qdrantUrl}\",\n          \"QDRANT_API_KEY\": \"${input:qdrantApiKey}\",\n          \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"${input:collectionName}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"qdrantUrl\",\n      \"description\": \"Qdrant URL\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"qdrantApiKey\",\n      \"description\": \"Qdrant API Key\",\n      \"password\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"collectionName\",\n      \"description\": \"Collection Name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"qdrant\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-qdrant\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"QDRANT_URL\": \"${input:qdrantUrl}\",\n        \"QDRANT_API_KEY\": \"${input:qdrantApiKey}\",\n        \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"${input:collectionName}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor workspace configuration with Docker, use this in `.vscode/mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"qdrantUrl\",\n      \"description\": \"Qdrant URL\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"qdrantApiKey\",\n      \"description\": \"Qdrant API Key\",\n      \"password\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"collectionName\",\n      \"description\": \"Collection Name\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"qdrant\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-p\", \"8000:8000\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-e\", \"QDRANT_URL\",\n        \"-e\", \"QDRANT_API_KEY\",\n        \"-e\", \"COLLECTION_NAME\",\n        \"mcp-server-qdrant\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"QDRANT_URL\": \"${input:qdrantUrl}\",\n        \"QDRANT_API_KEY\": \"${input:qdrantApiKey}\",\n        \"COLLECTION_NAME\": \"${input:collectionName}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have suggestions for how mcp-server-qdrant could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue!\nWe'd love all and any contributions.\n\n### Testing `mcp-server-qdrant` locally\n\nThe [MCP inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP\nservers.

The docs include:\n\n* Comprehensive overview, including details about the security features.\n* Quick start guide.\n* Multiple examples of configuring the server in your MCP client.\n* Sample prompts for invoking the core DX MCP tools.\n\n[Here are the release notes.](https://github.com/forcedotcom/mcp/tree/main/releasenotes)\n\n## Overview of the Salesforce DX MCP Server (Beta)\n\nThe Salesforce DX MCP Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation designed to facilitate seamless interaction between large language models (LLMs) and Salesforce orgs. This MCP server provides a robust set of tools and capabilities that enable LLMs to read, manage, and operate Salesforce resources securely.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> _Salesforce DX MCP Server is a pilot or beta service that is subject to the Beta Services Terms at [Agreements - Salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/) or a written Unified Pilot Agreement if executed by Customer, and applicable terms in the [Product Terms Directory](https://ptd.salesforce.com/). Use of this pilot or beta service is at the Customer's sole discretion._\n\n## Configure the DX MCP Server\n\nConfigure the Salesforce DX MCP Server for your MCP client by updating its associated MCP JSON file; each client is slightly different, so check your MCP client documentation for details. \n\nHere's an example for VS Code with Copilot in which you create and update a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project:\n\n```\n{\n     \"servers\": {\n       \"Salesforce DX\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@salesforce/mcp\", \n         \"--orgs\", \"DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG\", \n         \"--toolsets\", \"orgs,metadata,data,users\",\n         \"--tools\", \"run_apex_tests\",\n         \"--allow-non-ga-tools\"]\n       }\n     }\n}\n```\nThe `args` format shown in the preceding example is the same for all MCP clients; it's how you customize the DX MCP Server for your particular environment. Notes:\n\n- The `\"-y\", \"@salesforce/mcp\"` part tells `npx` to automatically install the `@salesforce/mcp` package instead of asking permission. Don't change this. \n- See the *Reference* sections below for the possible flags you can pass the `args` option, and possible values you can pass to the `--orgs`, `--toolsets`, and `--tools` flags. \n- When writing the `args` option, surround both the flag names and their values in double quotes, and separate all flags and values with commas. Some flags are Boolean and don't take a value.\n- The preceding example shows three flags that take a string value (`--orgs`, `--toolsets`, and `--tools`) and one Boolean flag (`--allow-non-ga-tools`).  This configuration starts a DX MCP Server that enables all the MCP tools in the `orgs`, `metadata`, `data`, and `users` toolsets and a specific tool called `run_apex_tests`.  It also enables tools in these configured toolsets that aren't yet generally available. \n\n<details>\n<summary>Reference: Available Flags for the `args` Option</summary>\n\n## Reference: Available Flags for the \"args\" Option\n\nThese are the flags that you can pass to the `args` option. \n\n| Flag Name | Description | Required? |Notes |\n| -----------------| -------| ------- | ----- |\n| `--orgs` | One or more orgs that you've locally authorized. | Yes | You must specify at least one org. <br/> <br/>See [Configure Orgs](README.md#configure-orgs) for the values you can pass to this flag. |\n| `--toolsets` | Sets of tools, based on functionality, that you want to enable. | No | Set to \"all\" to enable every tool in every toolset. <br/> <br/>See [Configure Toolsets](README.md#configure-toolsets) for the values you can pass to this flag.|\n| `--tools` | Individual tool names that you want to enable. | No | You can use this flag in combination with the `--toolsets` flag. For example, you can enable all tools in one toolset, and just one tool in a different toolset. |\n| `--no-telemetry` | Boolean flag to disable telemetry, the automatic collection of data for monitoring and analysis. | No | Telemetry is enabled by default, so specify this flag to disable it.  |\n| `--debug` | Boolean flag that requests that the DX MCP Server print debug logs. | No | Debug mode is disabled by default. <br/> <br/>**NOTE:** Not all MCP clients expose MCP logs, so this flag might not work for all IDEs. |\n| `--allow-non-ga-tools` | Boolean flag to allow the DX MCP Server to use both the generally available (GA) and NON-GA tools that are in the toolsets or tools you specify. | No | By default, the DX MCP server uses only the tools marked GA. |\n| `--dynamic-tools` | (experimental) Boolean flag that enables dynamic tool discovery and loading. When specified, the DX MCP server starts with a minimal set of core tools and loads new tools as needed. | No| This flag is useful for reducing the initial context size and improving LLM performance. Dynamic tool discovery is disabled by default.<br/> <br/>**NOTE:** This feature works in VSCode and Cline but may not work in other environments.|\n\n</details>\n<details>\n\n<summary>Reference: Configure Orgs</summary>\n\n## Configure Orgs\n\nThe Salesforce MCP tools require an org, and so you must include the required `--orgs` flag to specify at least one authorized org when you configure the MCP server. Separate multiple values with commas.\n\nYou must explicitly [authorize the orgs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_web_flow.htm) on your computer before the MCP server can access them. Use the `org login web` Salesforce CLI command or the VS Code **SFDX: Authorize an Org** command from the command palette.\n\nThese are the available values for the `--orgs` flag:\n\n| --orgs Value | Description |\n| -------- | ---------- |\n| `DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG` | Allow access to your default org. If you've set a local default org in your DX project, the MCP server uses it. If not, the server uses a globally-set default org.|\n| `DEFAULT_TARGET_DEV_HUB` | Allow access to your default Dev Hub org. If you've set a local default Dev Hub org in your DX project, the MCP server uses it. If not, the server uses a globally-set default Dev Hub org.|\n| `ALLOW_ALL_ORGS` | Allow access to all authorized orgs. Use this value with caution.|\n| `<username or alias>` | Allow access to a specific org by specifying its username or alias.|\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Reference: Configure Toolsets and Tools</summary>\n\n## Configure Toolsets\n\nThe Salesforce DX MCP Server supports **toolsets** - a way to selectively enable different groups of MCP tools based on your needs. This allows you to run the MCP server with only the tools you require, which in turn reduces the context.\n\nUse the `--toolsets` flag to specify the toolsets when you configure the Salesforce DX MCP Server. Separate multiple toolsets with commas. \n\nThese are the available toolsets.\n\n| Toolset| Description|\n| ----- | ----- |\n| `all` | Enables all available tools from all toolsets. Use caution, this will load over 60 tools. |\n| `orgs` | [Tools to manage your authorized orgs.](README.md#orgs-toolset)|\n| `data` | [Tools to manage the data in your org, such as listing all accounts.](README.md#data-toolset)|\n| `users` | [Tools to manage org users, such as assigning a permission set.](README.md#users-toolset)|\n| `metadata` | [Tools to deploy and retrieve metadata to and from your org and your DX project.](README.md#metadata-toolset)|\n| `testing` | [Tools to test your code and features](README.md#testing-toolset)|\n| `other` | [Other useful tools, such as tools for static analysis of your code using Salesforce Code Analyzer.](README.md#other-toolset)|\n| `mobile` | [Tools for mobile development and capabilities.](README.md#mobile-toolset)|\n| `mobile-core` | [A subset of mobile tools focused on essential mobile capabilities.](README.md#mobile-core-toolset)|\n| `aura-experts` | [Tools which provides Aura component analysis, blueprinting, and migration expertise.](README.md#aura-experts-toolset)|\n| `lwc-experts`  | [Tools to assist with LWC development, testing, optimization, and best practices.](README.md#lwc-experts-toolset)|\n\n## Configure Tools\n\nThe Salesforce DX MCP Server also supports registering individual **tools**. This can be used in combination with **toolsets** to further fine-tune registered tools.\n\nUse the `--tools` flag to enable specific tools when you configure the Salesforce DX MCP Server. Separate multiple tools with commas. The `--tools` flag is optional.\n\nThe following sections list all the tools that are included in a specific toolset. The tools marked NON-GA are not yet generally available, specify the `--allow-non-ga-tools` flag to use them. \n\n### Core Toolset (always enabled)\n\n- `get_username` - Determines the appropriate username or alias for Salesforce operations, handling both default orgs and Dev Hubs.\n- `resume_tool_operation` - Resumes a long-running operation that wasn't completed by another tool.\n\n### Orgs Toolset\n\n- `list_all_orgs` - Lists all configured Salesforce orgs, with optional connection status checking.\n- `create_org_snapshot` - (NON-GA) Create a scratch org snapshot. \n- `create_scratch_org` - (NON-GA) Create a scratch org. \n- `delete_org` - (NON-GA) Delete a locally-authorized Salesforce scratch org or sandbox.\n- `org_open` - (NON-GA) Open an org in a browser. \n\n**NOTE:** The tools marked NON-GA are not yet generally available, specify the `--allow-non-ga-tools` flag to use them. \n\n### Data Toolset\n\n- `run_soql_query` - Runs a SOQL query against a Salesforce org.\n\n### Users Toolset\n\n- `assign_permission_set` - Assigns a permission set to the user or on behalf of another user.\n\n### Metadata Toolset\n\n- `deploy_metadata` - Deploys metadata from your DX project to an org.\n- `retrieve_metadata` - Retrieves metadata from your org to your DX project.\n\n### Testing Toolset\n\n- `run_agent_test` - Executes agent tests in your org.\n- `run_apex_test` - Executes apex tests in your org.\n\n### Mobile Toolset\n\n- `create_mobile_lwc_app_review` - Provides TypeScript API documentation for Salesforce LWC App Review Service, offering expert guidance for implementing app review features in Lightning Web Components.\n- `create_mobile_lwc_ar_space_capture` -

For stdio, it will read from stdin\n  and write to stdout. For sse, it will start an HTTP server on port 8000.\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --version                Show version and exit.\n  -t, --transport [stdio|sse]  Transport protocol to use (stdio or sse)\n  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n### Standard Input/Output (stdio)\n\nThe stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#built-in-transport-types) for more details.\n\n#### Python\n\n```bash\nsemgrep-mcp\n```\n\nBy default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode. Because it's using the standard input and output streams, it will look like the tool is hanging without any output, but this is expected.\n\n#### Docker\n\nThis server is published to Github's Container Registry ([ghcr.io/semgrep/mcp](http://ghcr.io/semgrep/mcp))\n\n```\ndocker run -i --rm ghcr.io/semgrep/mcp -t stdio\n```\n\nBy default, the Docker container is in `SSE` mode, so you will have to include `-t stdio` after the image name and run with `-i` to run in [interactive](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#interactive) mode.\n\n### Streamable HTTP\n\nStreamable HTTP enables streaming responses over JSON RPC via HTTP POST requests. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http) for more details.\n\nBy default, the server listens on [127.0.0.1:8000/mcp](https://127.0.0.1/mcp) for client connections. To change any of this, set [FASTMCP\\_\\*](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/src/mcp/server/fastmcp/server.py#L78) environment variables. _The server must be running for clients to connect to it._\n\n#### Python\n\n```bash\nsemgrep-mcp -t streamable-http\n```\n\nBy default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode, so you will have to include `-t streamable-http`.\n\n#### Docker\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8000:0000 ghcr.io/semgrep/mcp\n```\n\n\n### Server-sent events (SSE)\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The MCP communiity considers this a legacy transport portcol and is really intended for backwards compatibility. [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http) is the recommended replacement.\n\nSSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with Server-Send Events for client-to-server and server-to-client communication. See the [spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse) for more details.\n\nBy default, the server listens on [127.0.0.1:8000/sse](https://127.0.0.1/sse) for client connections. To change any of this, set [FASTMCP\\_\\*](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/src/mcp/server/fastmcp/server.py#L78) environment variables. _The server must be running for clients to connect to it._\n\n#### Python\n\n```bash\nsemgrep-mcp -t sse\n```\n\nBy default, the Python package will run in `stdio` mode, so you will have to include `-t sse`.\n\n#### Docker\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8000:0000 ghcr.io/semgrep/mcp -t sse\n```\n\n## Semgrep AppSec Platform\n\nOptionally, to connect to Semgrep AppSec Platform:\n\n1. [Login](https://semgrep.dev/login/) or sign up\n1. Generate a token from [Settings](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens/api)\n1.

      "readme_content": "# Stripe Agent Toolkit\n\nThe Stripe Agent Toolkit enables popular agent frameworks including Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, CrewAI, and Vercel's AI SDK to integrate with Stripe APIs through function calling. The\nlibrary is not exhaustive of the entire Stripe API. It includes support for MCP, Python, and TypeScript and is built directly on top of the Stripe [Python][python-sdk] and [Node][node-sdk] SDKs.\n\nIncluded below are basic instructions, but refer to the [MCP](/modelcontextprotocol) [Python](/python), [TypeScript](/typescript) packages for more information.\n\n## Model Context Protocol\n\nStripe hosts a remote MCP server at `https://mcp.stripe.com`. This allows secure MCP client access via OAuth. View the docs [here](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp#remote).\n\nThe Stripe Agent Toolkit also exposes tools in the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.com/) format.  Or, to run a local Stripe MCP server using npx, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @stripe/mcp --tools=all --api-key=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY\n```\n\n## Python\n\n### Installation\n\nYou don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just\nwant to use the package run:\n\n```sh\npip install stripe-agent-toolkit\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.11+\n\n### Usage\n\nThe library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is\navailable in your [Stripe Dashboard][api-keys].\n\n```python\nfrom stripe_agent_toolkit.openai.toolkit import StripeAgentToolkit\n\nstripe_agent_toolkit = StripeAgentToolkit(\n    secret_key=\"sk_test_...\",\n    configuration={\n        \"actions\": {\n            \"payment_links\": {\n                \"create\": True,\n            },\n        }\n    },\n)\n```\n\nThe toolkit works with OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI and can be passed as a list of tools. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom agents import Agent\n\nstripe_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Stripe Agent\",\n    instructions=\"You are an expert at integrating with Stripe\",\n    tools=stripe_agent_toolkit.get_tools()\n)\n```\n\nExamples for OpenAI's Agent SDK,LangChain, and CrewAI are included in [/examples](/python/examples).\n\n#### Context\n\nIn some cases you will want to provide values that serve as defaults when making requests. Currently, the `account` context value enables you to make API calls for your [connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication).\n\n```python\nstripe_agent_toolkit = StripeAgentToolkit(\n    secret_key=\"sk_test_...\",\n    configuration={\n        \"context\": {\n            \"account\": \"acct_123\"\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\n### Installation\n\nYou don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just\nwant to use the package run:\n\n```\nnpm install @stripe/agent-toolkit\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Node 18+\n\n### Usage\n\nThe library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your [Stripe Dashboard][api-keys]. Additionally, `configuration` enables you to specify the types of actions that can be taken using the toolkit.\n\n```typescript\nimport { StripeAgentToolkit } from \"@stripe/agent-toolkit/langchain\";\n\nconst stripeAgentToolkit = new StripeAgentToolkit({\n  secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!,\n  configuration: {\n    actions: {\n      paymentLinks: {\n        create: true,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Tools\n\nThe toolkit works with LangChain and Vercel's AI SDK and can be passed as a list of tools. For example:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AgentExecutor, createStructuredChatAgent } from \"langchain/agents\";\n\nconst tools = stripeAgentToolkit.getTools();\n\nconst agent = await createStructuredChatAgent({\n  llm,\n  tools,\n  prompt,\n});\n\nconst agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({\n  agent,\n  tools,\n});\n```\n\n#### Context\n\nIn some cases you will want to provide values that serve as defaults when making requests. Currently, the `account` context value enables you to make API calls for your [connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication).\n\n```typescript\nconst stripeAgentToolkit = new StripeAgentToolkit({\n  secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!,\n  configuration: {\n    context: {\n      account: \"acct_123\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Metered billing\n\nFor Vercel's AI SDK, you can use middleware to submit billing events for usage. All that is required is the customer ID and the input/output meters to bill.\n\n```typescript\nimport { StripeAgentToolkit } from \"@stripe/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk\";\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\nimport {\n  generateText,\n  experimental_wrapLanguageModel as wrapLanguageModel,\n} from \"ai\";\n\nconst stripeAgentToolkit = new StripeAgentToolkit({\n  secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!,\n  configuration: {\n    actions: {\n      paymentLinks: {\n        create: true,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst model = wrapLanguageModel({\n  model: openai(\"gpt-4o\"),\n  middleware: stripeAgentToolkit.middleware({\n    billing: {\n      customer: \"cus_123\",\n      meters: {\n        input: \"input_tokens\",\n        output: \"output_tokens\",\n      },\n    },\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n\n\n## Supported API methods\n\n- [Cancel a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel)\n- [Create a coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/create)\n- [Create a customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n- [Create a payment link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment-link/create)\n- [Create a price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create)\n- [Create a product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/create)\n- [Create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/create)\n- [Create an invoice item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create)\n- [Create an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)\n- [Finalize an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)\n- [List all coupons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/list)\n- [List all customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/list)\n- [List all disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list)\n- [List all prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/list)\n- [List all products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list)\n- [List all subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/list)\n- [Retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve)\n- [Update a dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update)\n- [Update a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update)\n\n[python-sdk]: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python\n[node-sdk]: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node\n[api-keys]: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys\n",

This provides a seamless experience without requiring local installation or configuration.\n\nSimply use the remote MCP server URL with your Tavily API key:\n\n``` \nhttps://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key> \n```\n Get your Tavily API key from [tavily.com](https://www.tavily.com/).\n\n\n### Connect to Cursor\n[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=tavily-remote-mcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IG1jcC1yZW1vdGUgaHR0cHM6Ly9tY3AudGF2aWx5LmNvbS9tY3AvP3RhdmlseUFwaUtleT08eW91ci1hcGkta2V5PiIsImVudiI6e319)\n\nClick the ⬆️ Add to Cursor ⬆️ button, this will do most of the work for you but you will still need to edit the configuration to add your API-KEY. You can get a Tavily API key [here](https://www.tavily.com/).\n\n\nonce you click the button you should be redirect to Cursor ...\n\n### Step 1\nClick the install button\n\n![](assets/cursor-step1.png)\n\n\n### Step 2\nYou should see the MCP is now installed, if the blue slide is not already turned on, manually turn it on. You also need to edit the configuration to include your own Tavily API key.\n![](assets/cursor-step2.png)\n\n### Step 3\nYou will then be redirected to your `mcp.json` file where you have to add `your-api-key`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"tavily-remote-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>\",\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Connect to Claude Desktop\n\nClaude desktop now supports adding `integrations` which is currently in beta. An integration in this case is the Tavily Remote MCP, below I will explain how to add the MCP as an `integration` in Claude desktop.\n\n### Step 1 \nopen claude desktop, click the button with the two sliders and then navigate to add integrations.\n![](assets/claude-step1.png)\n\n### Step 2\nclick `Add integrations`\n![](assets/claude-step2.png)\n\n### Step 3\nName the integration and insert the Tavily remote MCP url with your API key. You can get a Tavily API key [here](https://www.tavily.com/). Click `Add` to confirm.\n![](assets/claude-step3.png)\n\n### Step 4\nRetrun to the chat screen and you will see the Tavily Remote MCP is now connected to Claude desktop.\n![](assets/claude-step4.png)\n\n### OpenAI \nAllow models to use remote MCP servers to perform tasks.\n- You first need to export your OPENAI_API_KEY\n- You must also add your Tavily API-key to `<your-api-key>`, you can get a Tavily API key [here](https://www.tavily.com/)\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nresp = client.responses.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4.1\",\n    tools=[\n        {\n            \"type\": \"mcp\",\n            \"server_label\": \"tavily\",\n            \"server_url\": \"https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>\",\n            \"require_approval\": \"never\",\n        },\n    ],\n    input=\"Do you have access to the tavily mcp server?\",\n)\n\nprint(resp.output_text)\n```\n\n### Clients that don't support remote MCPs\n\nmcp-remote is a lightweight bridge that lets MCP clients that can only talk to local (stdio) servers securely connect to remote MCP servers over HTTP + SSE with OAuth-based auth, so you can host and update your server in the cloud while existing clients keep working. It serves as an experimental stop-gap until popular MCP clients natively support remote, authorized servers.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tavily-remote\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>\"\n      ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Local MCP \n\n### Prerequisites 🔧\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have:\n\n- [Tavily API key](https://app.tavily.com/home)\n  - If you don't have a Tavily API key, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://app.tavily.com/home)\n- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher)\n  - You can verify your Node.js installation by running:\n    - `node --version`\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed (only needed if using Git installation method)\n  - On macOS: `brew install git`\n  - On Linux: \n    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`\n    - RedHat/CentOS: `sudo yum install git`\n  - On Windows: Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)\n\n## Tavily MCP server installation ⚡\n\n### Running with NPX \n\n```bash\nnpx -y tavily-mcp@latest \n```\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Tavily MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@tavily-ai/tavily-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @tavily-ai/tavily-mcp --client claude\n```\n\nAlthough you can launch a server on its own, it's not particularly helpful in isolation. Instead, you should integrate it into an MCP client. Below is an example of how to configure the Claude Desktop app to work with the tavily-mcp server.\n\n\n## Configuring MCP Clients ⚙️\n\nThis repository will explain how to configure [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) to work with the tavily-mcp server.\n\n### Configuring VS Code 💻\n\nFor one-click installation, click one of the install buttons below:\n\n[![Install with NPX in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-NPM-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D) [![Install with NPX in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-NPM-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=tavily&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22tavily-mcp%400.1.4%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TAVILY_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atavily_api_key%7D%22%7D%7D&inputs=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22tavily_api_key%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22Tavily+API+Key%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nFirst check if there are install buttons at the top of this section that match your needs. If you prefer manual installation, follow these steps:\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"promptString\",\n        \"id\": \"tavily_api_key\",\n        \"description\": \"Tavily API Key\",\n        \"password\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"tavily\": {\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\"-y\", \"tavily-mcp@latest\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"TAVILY_API_KEY\": \"${input:tavily_api_key}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"promptString\",\n      \"id\": \"tavily_api_key\",\n      \"description\": \"Tavily API Key\",\n      \"password\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"tavily\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"tavily-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"TAVILY_API_KEY\": \"${input:tavily_api_key}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuring Cline 🤖\n\nThe easiest way to set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline is through the marketplace with a single click:\n\n1. Open Cline in VS Code\n2. Click on the Cline icon in the sidebar\n3. Navigate to the \"MCP Servers\" tab ( 4 squares )\n4. Search \"Tavily\" and click \"install\"\n5. When prompted, enter your Tavily API key\n\nAlternatively, you can manually set up the Tavily MCP server in Cline:\n\n1. Open the Cline MCP settings file:\n\n   ### For macOS:\n   ```bash\n   # Using Visual Studio Code\n   code ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json\n   \n   # Or using TextEdit\n   open -e ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json\n   ```\n\n   ### For Windows:\n   ```bash\n   code %APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\globalStorage\\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\\settings\\cline_mcp_settings.json\n   ```\n\n2. Add the Tavily server configuration to the file:\n\n   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/api-keys).\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"tavily-mcp\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"tavily-mcp@latest\"],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"TAVILY_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n         },\n         \"disabled\": false,\n         \"autoApprove\": []\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and restart Cline if it's already running.\n\n4. When using Cline, you'll now have access to the Tavily MCP tools. You can ask Cline to use the tavily-search and tavily-extract tools directly in your conversations.\n\n\n### Configuring the Claude Desktop app 🖥️\n### For macOS:\n\n```bash\n# Create the config file if it doesn't exist\ntouch \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\"\n\n# Opens the config file in TextEdit \nopen -e \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\"\n\n# Alternative method using Visual Studio Code (requires VS Code to be installed)\ncode \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\"\n```\n\n### For Windows:\n```bash\ncode %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n### Add the Tavily server configuration:\n\nReplace `your-api-key-here` with your actual [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com/api-keys).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"tavily-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"tavily-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"TAVILY_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\n\nLara Translate MCP Server enables AI applications to access Lara Translate's powerful translation capabilities through this standardized protocol.\n\n> More info about Model Context Protocol on: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How Lara Translate MCP Works</strong></summary>\n\nLara Translate MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol to provide seamless translation capabilities to AI applications. The integration follows this flow:\n\n1. **Connection Establishment**: When an MCP-compatible AI application starts, it connects to configured MCP servers, including the Lara Translate MCP Server\n2. **Tool & Resource Discovery**: The AI application discovers available translation tools and resources provided by the Lara Translate MCP Server\n3. **Request Processing**: When translation needs are identified:\n   - The AI application formats a structured request with text to translate, language pairs, and optional context\n   - The MCP server validates the request and transforms it into Lara Translate API calls\n   - The request is securely sent to Lara Translate's API using your credentials\n4. **Translation & Response**: Lara Translate processes the translation using advanced AI models\n5. **Result Integration**: The translation results are returned to the AI application, which can then incorporate them into its response\n\nThis integration architecture allows AI applications to access professional-grade translations without implementing the API directly, while maintaining the security of your API credentials and offering flexibility to adjust translation parameters through natural language instructions.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Why to use Lara inside an LLM</strong></summary>\n\nIntegrating Lara with LLMs creates a powerful synergy that significantly enhances translation quality for non-English languages.\n\n#### Why General LLMs Fall Short in Translation\nWhile large language models possess broad linguistic capabilities, they often lack the specialized expertise and up-to-date terminology required for accurate translations in specific domains and languages.\n\n#### Lara’s Domain-Specific Advantage\nLara overcomes this limitation by leveraging Translation Language Models (T-LMs) trained on billions of professionally translated segments. These models provide domain-specific machine translation that captures cultural nuances and industry terminology that generic LLMs may miss. The result: translations that are contextually accurate and sound natural to native speakers.\n\n#### Designed for Non-English Strength\nLara has a strong focus on non-English languages, addressing the performance gap found in models such as GPT-4. The dominance of English in datasets such as Common Crawl and Wikipedia results in lower quality output in other languages. Lara helps close this gap by providing higher quality understanding, generation, and restructuring in a multilingual context.\n\n#### Faster, Smarter Multilingual Performance\nBy offloading complex translation tasks to specialized T-LMs, Lara reduces computational overhead and minimizes latency—a common issue for LLMs handling non-English input. Its architecture processes translations in parallel with the LLM, enabling for real-time, high-quality output without compromising speed or efficiency.\n\n#### Cost-Efficient Translation at Scale\nLara also lowers the cost of using models like GPT-4 in non-English workflows. Since tokenization (and pricing) is optimized for English, using Lara allows translation to take place before hitting the LLM, meaning that only the translated English content is processed. This improves cost efficiency and supports competitive scalability for global enterprises.\n</details>\n\n## 🛠 Available Tools\n\n### Translation Tools\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>translate</strong> - Translate text between languages</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `text` (array): An array of text blocks to translate, each with:\n    - `text` (string): The text content\n    - `translatable` (boolean): Whether this block should be translated\n- `source` (optional string): Source language code (e.g., 'en-EN')\n- `target` (string): Target language code (e.g., 'it-IT')\n- `context` (optional string): Additional context to improve translation quality\n- `instructions` (optional string[]): Instructions to adjust translation behavior\n- `source_hint` (optional string): Guidance for language detection\n\n**Returns**: Translated text blocks maintaining the original structure\n</details>\n\n### Translation Memories Tools\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>list_memories</strong> - List saved translation memories</summary>\n\n**Returns**: Array of memories and their details\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>create_memory</strong> - Create a new translation memory</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `name` (string): Name of the new memory\n- `external_id` (optional string): ID of the memory to import from MyMemory (e.g., 'ext_my_[MyMemory ID]')\n\n**Returns**: Created memory data\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>update_memory</strong> - Update translation memory name</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string): ID of the memory to update\n- `name` (string): The new name for the memory\n\n**Returns**: Updated memory data\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>delete_memory</strong> - Delete a translation memory</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string): ID of the memory to delete\n\n**Returns**: Deleted memory data\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>add_translation</strong> - Add a translation unit to memory</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string | string[]): ID or IDs of memories where to add the translation unit\n- `source` (string): Source language code\n- `target` (string): Target language code\n- `sentence` (string): The source sentence\n- `translation` (string): The translated sentence\n- `tuid` (optional string): Translation Unit unique identifier\n- `sentence_before` (optional string): Context sentence before\n- `sentence_after` (optional string): Context sentence after\n\n**Returns**: Added translation details\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>delete_translation</strong> - Delete a translation unit from memory</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string): ID of the memory\n- `source` (string): Source language code\n- `target` (string): Target language code\n- `sentence` (string): The source sentence\n- `translation` (string): The translated sentence\n- `tuid` (optional string): Translation Unit unique identifier\n- `sentence_before` (optional string): Context sentence before\n- `sentence_after` (optional string): Context sentence after\n\n**Returns**: Removed translation details\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>import_tmx</strong> - Import a TMX file into a memory</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string): ID of the memory to update\n- `tmx_content` (string): The content of the tmx file to upload\n- `gzip` (boolean): Indicates if the file is compressed (.gz)\n\n**Returns**: Import details\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>check_import_status</strong> - Checks the status of a TMX file import</summary>\n\n**Inputs**:\n- `id` (string): The ID of the import job\n\n**Returns**: Import details\n</details>\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\nLara supports both the STDIO and streamable HTTP protocols.

Repomix has been nominated for the **Powered by AI** category at the [JSNation Open Source Awards 2025](https://osawards.com/javascript/).\n\nThis wouldn't have been possible without all of you using and supporting Repomix. Thank you!\n\n## 🎉 New: Repomix Website & Discord Community!\n\n- Try Repomix in your browser at [repomix.com](https://repomix.com/)\n- Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wNYzTwZFku) for support and discussion\n\n**We look forward to seeing you there!**\n\n## 🌟 Features\n\n- **AI-Optimized**: Formats your codebase in a way that's easy for AI to understand and process.\n- **Token Counting**: Provides token counts for each file and the entire repository, useful for LLM context limits.\n- **Simple to Use**: You need just one command to pack your entire repository.\n- **Customizable**: Easily configure what to include or exclude.\n- **Git-Aware**: Automatically respects your `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude`.\n- **Security-Focused**: Incorporates [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) for robust security checks to detect and prevent inclusion of sensitive information.\n- **Code Compression**: The `--compress` option uses [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to extract key code elements, reducing token count while preserving structure.\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Using the CLI Tool `>_`\n\nYou can try Repomix instantly in your project directory without installation:\n\n```bash\nnpx repomix@latest\n```\n\nOr install globally for repeated use:\n\n```bash\n# Install using npm\nnpm install -g repomix\n\n# Alternatively using yarn\nyarn global add repomix\n\n# Alternatively using bun\nbun add -g repomix\n\n# Alternatively using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)\nbrew install repomix\n\n# Then run in any project directory\nrepomix\n```\n\nThat's it! Repomix will generate a `repomix-output.xml` file in your current directory, containing your entire\nrepository in an AI-friendly format.\n\nYou can then send this file to an AI assistant with a prompt like:\n\n```\nThis file contains all the files in the repository combined into one.\nI want to refactor the code, so please review it first.\n```\n\n![Repomix File Usage 1](website/client/src/public/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-1.png)\n\nWhen you propose specific changes, the AI might be able to generate code accordingly. With features like Claude's\nArtifacts, you could potentially output multiple files, allowing for the generation of multiple interdependent pieces of\ncode.\n\n![Repomix File Usage 2](website/client/src/public/images/docs/repomix-file-usage-2.png)\n\nHappy coding! 🚀\n\n### Using The Website 🌐\n\nWant to try it quickly?

Plus, it works smoothly with your existing repomix.config.json.\n\nTry it now on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DorianMassoulier.repomix-runner)!\nSource code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/massdo/repomix-runner).\n\n### Alternative Tools 🛠️\n\nIf you're using Python, you might want to check out `Gitingest`, which is better suited for Python ecosystem and data\nscience workflows:\nhttps://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest\n\n## 📊 Usage\n\nTo pack your entire repository:\n\n```bash\nrepomix\n```\n\nTo pack a specific directory:\n\n```bash\nrepomix path/to/directory\n```\n\nTo pack specific files or directories\nusing [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax):\n\n```bash\nrepomix --include \"src/**/*.ts,**/*.md\"\n```\n\nTo exclude specific files or directories:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --ignore \"**/*.log,tmp/\"\n```\n\nTo pack a remote repository:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\n\n# You can also use GitHub shorthand:\nrepomix --remote yamadashy/repomix\n\n# You can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main\n\n# Or use a specific commit hash:\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695\n\n# Another convenient way is specifying the branch's URL\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main\n\n# Commit's URL is also supported\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1\n\n```\n\nTo pack files from a file list (pipe via stdin):\n\n```bash\n# Using find command\nfind src -name \"*.ts\" -type f | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using git to get tracked files\ngit ls-files \"*.ts\" | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using grep to find files containing specific content\ngrep -l \"TODO\" **/*.ts | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using ripgrep to find files with specific content\nrg -l \"TODO|FIXME\" --type ts | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using ripgrep (rg) to find files\nrg --files --type ts | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using sharkdp/fd to find files\nfd -e ts | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using fzf to select from all files\nfzf -m | repomix --stdin\n\n# Interactive file selection with fzf\nfind . -name \"*.ts\" -type f | fzf -m | repomix --stdin\n\n# Using ls with glob patterns\nls src/**/*.ts | repomix --stdin\n\n# From a file containing file paths\ncat file-list.txt | repomix --stdin\n\n# Direct input with echo\necho -e \"src/index.ts\\nsrc/utils.ts\" | repomix --stdin\n```\n\nThe `--stdin` option allows you to pipe a list of file paths to Repomix, giving you ultimate flexibility in selecting which files to pack.\n\nWhen using `--stdin`, the specified files are effectively added to the include patterns. This means that the normal include and ignore behavior still applies - files specified via stdin will still be excluded if they match ignore patterns.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> When using `--stdin`, file paths can be relative or absolute, and Repomix will automatically handle path resolution and deduplication.\n\nTo include git logs in the output:\n\n```bash\n# Include git logs with default count (50 commits)\nrepomix --include-logs\n\n# Include git logs with specific commit count\nrepomix --include-logs --include-logs-count 10\n\n# Combine with diffs for comprehensive git context\nrepomix --include-logs --include-diffs\n```\n\nThe git logs include commit dates, messages, and file paths for each commit, providing valuable context for AI analysis of code evolution and development patterns.\n\nTo compress the output:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --compress\n\n# You can also use it with remote repositories:\nrepomix --remote yamadashy/repomix --compress\n```\n\nTo initialize a new configuration file (`repomix.config.json`):\n\n```bash\nrepomix --init\n```\n\nOnce you have generated the packed file, you can use it with Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Grok, and more.\n\n### Docker Usage 🐳\n\nYou can also run Repomix using Docker.  \nThis is useful if you want to run Repomix in an isolated environment or prefer using containers.\n\nBasic usage (current directory):\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nTo pack a specific directory:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v .:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix path/to/directory\n```\n\nProcess a remote repository and output to a `output` directory:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v ./output:/app -it --rm ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\n### Prompt Examples\n\nOnce you have generated the packed file with Repomix, you can use it with AI tools like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Gemini, Gemma, Llama, Grok, and more.\nHere are some example prompts to get you started:\n\n#### Code Review and Refactoring\n\nFor a comprehensive code review and refactoring suggestions:\n\n```\nThis file contains my entire codebase.

Your insights could help others make better use of\nRepomix.\n\n### Output File Format\n\nRepomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  \nTo enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to\nunderstand the context and structure of the packed repository.\n\n#### XML Format (default)\n\nThe XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n```xml\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n<file_summary>\n  (Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n</file_summary>\n\n<directory_structure>\nsrc/\ncli/\ncliOutput.ts\nindex.ts\n\n(...remaining directories)\n</directory_structure>\n\n<files>\n<file path=\"src/index.js\">\n  // File contents here\n</file>\n\n(...remaining files)\n</files>\n\n<instruction>\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n</instruction>\n```\n\nFor those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags\n\n> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a\n> game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.\n\nThis means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed\nyour codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.\n\n#### Markdown Format\n\nTo generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style markdown\n```\n\nThe Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n````markdown\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n# File Summary\n\n(Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n\n# Repository Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n```\n\n(...remaining directories)\n\n# Repository Files\n\n## File: src/index.js\n\n```\n// File contents here\n```\n\n(...remaining files)\n\n# Instruction\n\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n````\n\nThis format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.\n\n#### JSON Format\n\nTo generate output in JSON format, use the `--style json` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style json\n```\n\nThe JSON format structures the content as a hierarchical JSON object with camelCase property names:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fileSummary\": {\n    \"generationHeader\": \"This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.\",\n    \"purpose\": \"This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents...\",\n    \"fileFormat\": \"The content is organized as follows...\",\n    \"usageGuidelines\": \"- This file should be treated as read-only...\",\n    \"notes\": \"- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules...\"\n  },\n  \"userProvidedHeader\": \"Custom header text if specified\",\n  \"directoryStructure\": \"src/\\n  cli/\\n    cliOutput.ts\\n    index.ts\\n  config/\\n    configLoader.ts\",\n  \"files\": {\n    \"src/index.js\": \"// File contents here\",\n    \"src/utils.js\": \"// File contents here\"\n  },\n  \"instruction\": \"Custom instructions from instructionFilePath\"\n}\n```\n\nThis format is ideal for:\n- **Programmatic processing**: Easy to parse and manipulate with JSON libraries\n- **API integration**: Direct consumption by web services and applications  \n- **AI tool compatibility**: Structured format for machine learning and AI systems\n- **Data analysis**: Straightforward extraction of specific information using tools like `jq`\n\n##### Working with JSON Output Using `jq`\n\nThe JSON format makes it easy to extract specific information programmatically:\n\n```bash\n# List all file paths\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'\n\n# Count total number of files\ncat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'\n\n# Extract specific file content\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files[\"README.md\"]'\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files[\"src/index.js\"]'\n\n# Find files by extension\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(\".ts\"))'\n\n# Get files containing specific text\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains(\"function\")) | .key'\n\n# Extract directory structure\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'\n\n# Get file summary information\ncat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'\n\n# Extract user-provided header (if exists)\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // \"No header provided\"'\n\n# Create a file list with sizes\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | \"\\(.key): \\(.value | length) characters\"'\n```\n\n#### Plain Text Format\n\nTo generate output in plain text format, use the `--style plain` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style plain\n```\n\n```text\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n================================================================\nFile Summary\n================================================================\n(Metadata and usage AI

what this code does.\"\n\n# Custom output with compression\nrepomix --compress\n\n# Process specific files\nrepomix --include \"src/**/*.ts\" --ignore \"**/*.test.ts\"\n\n# Remote repository with branch\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main\n\n# Remote repository with commit\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1\n\n# Remote repository with shorthand\nrepomix --remote user/repo\n```\n\n### Updating Repomix\n\nTo update a globally installed Repomix:\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm update -g repomix\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn global upgrade repomix\n\n# Using bun\nbun update -g repomix\n```\n\nUsing `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.\n\n### Remote Repository Processing\n\nRepomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to\nquickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.\n\nTo process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can also use GitHub's shorthand format:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:\n\n```bash\n# Using --remote-branch option\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main\n\n# Using branch's URL\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main\n```\n\nOr use a specific commit hash:\n\n```bash\n# Using --remote-branch option\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695\n\n# Using commit's URL\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1\n```\n\n### Code Compression\n\nThe `--compress` option utilizes [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to perform intelligent code extraction, focusing on essential function and class signatures while removing implementation details. This can help reduce token count while retaining important structural information.\n\n```bash\nrepomix --compress\n```\n\nFor example, this code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';\n\n/**\n * Calculate the total price of shopping items\n */\nconst calculateTotal = (\n  items: ShoppingItem[]\n) => {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const item of items) {\n    total += item.price * item.quantity;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\n// Shopping item interface\ninterface Item {\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n  quantity: number;\n}\n```\n\nWill be compressed to:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';\n⋮----\n/**\n * Calculate the total price of shopping items\n */\nconst calculateTotal = (\n  items: ShoppingItem[]\n) => {\n⋮----\n// Shopping item interface\ninterface Item {\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n  quantity: number;\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage\n\n### Token Count Optimization\n\nUnderstanding your codebase's token distribution is crucial for optimizing AI interactions. Use the `--token-count-tree` option to visualize token usage across your project:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --token-count-tree\n```\n\nThis displays a hierarchical view of your codebase with token counts:\n\n```\n🔢 Token Count Tree:\n────────────────────\n└── src/ (70,925 tokens)\n    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)\n    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)\n    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)\n    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)\n        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)\n        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)\n```\n\nYou can also set a minimum token threshold to focus on larger files:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Only show files/directories with 1000+ tokens\n```\n\nThis helps you:\n- **Identify token-heavy files** that might exceed AI context limits\n- **Optimize file selection** using `--include` and `--ignore` patterns  \n- **Plan compression strategies** by targeting the largest contributors\n- **Balance content vs. context** when preparing code for AI analysis\n\n### MCP Server Integration\n\nRepomix supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), allowing AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase. When run as an MCP server, Repomix provides tools that enable AI assistants to package local or remote repositories for analysis without requiring manual file preparation.\n\n```bash\nrepomix --mcp\n```\n\n#### Configuring MCP Servers\n\nTo use Repomix as an MCP server with AI assistants like Claude, you need to configure the MCP settings:\n\n**For VS Code:**\n\nYou can install the Repomix MCP server in VS Code using one of these methods:\n\n1. **Using the Install Badge:**\n\n  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)\n  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n2. **Using the Command Line:**\n\n  ```bash\n  code --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"repomix\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"-y\",\"repomix\",\"--mcp\"]}'\n  ```\n\n  For VS Code Insiders:\n  ```bash\n  code-insiders --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"repomix\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"-y\",\"repomix\",\"--mcp\"]}'\n  ```\n\n**For Cline (VS Code extension):**\n\nEdit the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"repomix\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"repomix\",\n        \"--mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For Cursor:**\n\nIn Cursor, add a new MCP server from `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` with a configuration similar to Cline.\n\n**For Claude Desktop:**\n\nEdit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file with similar configuration to Cline's config.\n\n**For Claude Code:**\n\nTo configure Repomix as an MCP server in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), use the following command:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp\n```\n\n**Using Docker instead of npx:**\n\nYou can use Docker as an alternative to npx for running Repomix as an MCP server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"repomix-docker\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix\",\n        \"--mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce configured, your AI assistant can directly use Repomix's capabilities to analyze codebases without manual file preparation, making code analysis workflows more efficient.\n\n#### Available MCP Tools\n\nWhen running as an MCP server, Repomix provides the following tools:\n\n1. **pack_codebase**: Package a local code directory into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis\n  - Parameters:\n    - `directory`: Absolute path to the directory to pack\n    - `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.\n    - `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., \"**/*.{js,ts}\", \"src/**,docs/**\"). Only matching files will be processed.\n    - `ignorePatterns`: (Optional) Specify additional files to exclude using fast-glob patterns. Multiple patterns can be comma-separated (e.g., \"test/**,*.spec.js\", \"node_modules/**,dist/**\"). These patterns supplement .gitignore and built-in exclusions.\n    - `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary for codebase analysis.\n\n2. **attach_packed_output**: Attach an existing Repomix packed output file for AI analysis\n  - Parameters:\n    - `path`: Path to a directory containing repomix-output.xml or direct path to a packed repository XML file\n    - `topFilesLength`: (Optional, default: 10) Number of largest files by size to display in the metrics summary\n  - Features:\n    - Accepts either a directory containing a repomix-output.xml file or a direct path to an XML file\n    - Registers the file with the MCP server and returns the same structure as the pack_codebase tool\n    - Provides secure access to existing packed outputs without requiring re-processing\n    - Useful for working with previously generated packed repositories\n\n3. **pack_remote_repository**: Fetch, clone, and package a GitHub repository into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis\n  - Parameters:\n    - `remote`: GitHub repository URL or user/repo format (e.g., \"yamadashy/repomix\", \"https://github.com/user/repo\", or \"https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch\")\n    - `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details. Reduces token usage by ~70% while preserving semantic meaning. Generally not needed since grep_repomix_output allows incremental content retrieval. Use only when you specifically need the entire codebase content for large repositories.\n    - `includePatterns`: (Optional) Specify files to include using fast-glob patterns.

See [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) for encoding details. | `\"o200k_base\"`         |\n\nThe configuration file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax, which allows:\n- Comments (both single-line and multi-line)\n- Trailing commas in objects and arrays\n- Unquoted property names\n- More relaxed string syntax\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"input\": {\n    \"maxFileSize\": 50000000\n  },\n  \"output\": {\n    \"filePath\": \"repomix-output.xml\",\n    \"style\": \"xml\",\n    \"parsableStyle\": false,\n    \"compress\": false,\n    \"headerText\": \"Custom header information for the packed file.\",\n    \"fileSummary\": true,\n    \"directoryStructure\": true,\n    \"files\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"removeEmptyLines\": false,\n    \"topFilesLength\": 5,\n    \"tokenCountTree\": false, // or true, or a number like 10 for minimum token threshold\n    \"showLineNumbers\": false,\n    \"truncateBase64\": false,\n    \"copyToClipboard\": false,\n    \"includeEmptyDirectories\": false,\n    \"git\": {\n      \"sortByChanges\": true,\n      \"sortByChangesMaxCommits\": 100,\n      \"includeDiffs\": false,\n      \"includeLogs\": false,\n      \"includeLogsCount\": 50\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*\"],\n  \"ignore\": {\n    \"useGitignore\": true,\n    \"useDefaultPatterns\": true,\n    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore\n    \"customPatterns\": [\n      \"additional-folder\",\n      \"**/*.log\"\n    ],\n  },\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": true\n  },\n  \"tokenCount\": {\n    \"encoding\": \"o200k_base\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Global Configuration\n\nTo create a global configuration file:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --init --global\n```\n\nThe global configuration file will be created in:\n\n- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Repomix\\repomix.config.json`\n- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`\n\nNote: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.\n\n### Include and Ignore\n\n#### Include Patterns\n\nRepomix now supports specifying files to include\nusing [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more\nflexible and powerful file selection:\n\n- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory\n- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories\n- Combine multiple patterns like `[\"src/**/*.js\", \"**/*.md\"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown\n  files\n\n#### Ignore Patterns\n\nRepomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing\nprocess:\n\n- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting or the `--no-gitignore` cli option.\n- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules,\n  .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting or the `--no-default-patterns` cli option. Please\n  see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.\n- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore\n  patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.\n- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the\n  configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.\n\nPriority Order (from highest to lowest):\n\n1. Custom patterns `ignore.customPatterns`\n2. `.repomixignore`\n3. `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` (if `ignore.useGitignore` is true and `--no-gitignore` is not used)\n4. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true and `--no-default-patterns` is not used)\n\nThis approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size\nof the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while\npreventing the leakage of confidential information.\n\nNote: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the \"Repository\nStructure\" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the\npacked file efficient and text-based.\n\n### Custom Instruction\n\nThe `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or\ncontext about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project,\npotentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this feature:\n\n1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:\n\n```markdown\n# Coding Guidelines\n\n- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide\n- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate\n- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English\n- All new features should have corresponding unit tests\n\n# Generate Comprehensive Output\n\n- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise\n- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality\n```\n\n2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"instructionFilePath\": \"repomix-instruction.md\",\n    // other options...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.\n\nNote: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective\nfor AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in\ntheir documentation:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips\n\n> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above\n> your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.\n> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.\n\n### Comment Removal\n\nWhen `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This\nfeature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.\n\nSupported languages include:  \nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell,\nand YAML.\n\nNote: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments\nmight be retained.\n\n## 🔍 Security Check\n\nRepomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect\npotentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing\nyour packed repository.\n\nThe security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious\nfiles are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\n🔍 Security Check:\n──────────────────\n2 suspicious file(s) detected:\n1. src/utils/test.txt\n2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts\n\nPlease review these files for potentially sensitive information.\n```\n\nBy default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to\n`false` in your configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr using the `--no-security-check` command line option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --no-security-check\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Disabling security checks may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary, such\n> as when working with test files or documentation that contains example credentials.\n\n## 🤖 Using Repomix with GitHub Actions\n\nYou can also use Repomix in your GitHub Actions workflows.

The only cases where an internet connection is needed are:\n  - Installation via npm/yarn.\n  - Using the `--remote` flag to process remote repositories.\n  - Checking for updates (manually triggered).\n- **Security Considerations**: Since all processing is local, Repomix CLI is safe to use with private and internal repositories.\n\n### Repomix Website ([repomix.com](https://repomix.com/))\n\n- **Data Collection**: The Repomix website uses **Google Analytics** to collect usage data, such as page views and user interactions. This helps us understand how the website is used and improve the user experience.\n- **File Processing**: When uploading ZIP files or folders, your files are temporarily stored on our servers for processing. All uploaded files and processed data are automatically deleted immediately after processing is complete.\n\n### Repomix Browser Extension\n\n- **Data Collection**: The Repomix browser extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any user data, telemetry, or repository information.\n- **Permissions**: The extension only requires minimal permissions necessary to add the Repomix button to GitHub repository pages. It does not access or modify repository data.\n\n### Liability Disclaimer\n\nRepomix (the CLI tool, website, and browser extension) is provided \"as is\" without any warranties or guarantees.  \nWe do not take responsibility for how the generated output is used, including but not limited to its accuracy, legality, or any potential consequences arising from its use.\n\n## 📜 License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <a href=\"#repo-content-pjax-container\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Back To Top\n  </a>\n</p>\n",
