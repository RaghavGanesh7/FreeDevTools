By leveraging tools built on top of Wireshark's `tshark`, WireMCP captures and processes live network data, providing LLMs with structured context to assist in tasks like threat hunting, network diagnostics, and anomaly detection.\n\n# Features\nWireMCP exposes the following tools to MCP clients, enhancing LLM understanding of network activity:\n\n- **`capture_packets`**: Captures live traffic and returns raw packet data as JSON, enabling LLMs to analyze packet-level details (e.g., IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods).\n- **`get_summary_stats`**: Provides protocol hierarchy statistics, giving LLMs an overview of traffic composition (e.g., TCP vs. UDP usage).\n- **`get_conversations`**: Delivers TCP/UDP conversation statistics, allowing LLMs to track communication flows between endpoints.\n- **`check_threats`**: Captures IPs and checks them against the URLhaus blacklist, equipping LLMs with threat intelligence context for identifying malicious activity.\n- **`check_ip_threats`**: Performs targeted threat intelligence lookups for specific IP addresses against multiple threat feeds, providing detailed reputation and threat data.\n- **`analyze_pcap`**: Analyzes PCAP files to provide comprehensive packet data in JSON format, enabling detailed post-capture analysis of network traffic.\n- **`extract_credentials`**: Scans PCAP files for potential credentials from various protocols (HTTP Basic Auth, FTP, Telnet), aiding in security audits and forensic analysis.\n\n\n## How It Helps LLMs\nWireMCP bridges the gap between raw network data and LLM comprehension by:\n- **Contextualizing Traffic**: Converts live packet captures into structured outputs (JSON, stats) that LLMs can parse and reason about.\n- **Threat Detection**: Integrates IOCs (currently URLhaus) to flag suspicious IPs, enhancing LLM-driven security analysis.\n- **Diagnostics**: Offers detailed traffic insights, enabling LLMs to assist with troubleshooting or identifying anomalies.\n- **Narrative Generation**: LLM's can Transform complex packet captures into coherent stories, making network analysis accessible to non-technical users.\n\n# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Mac / Windows / Linux\n- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (with `tshark` installed and accessible in PATH)\n- Node.js (v16+ recommended)\n- npm (for dependency installation)\n\n## Setup\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/0xkoda/WireMCP.git\n   cd WireMCP\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Run the MCP server:\n   ```bash\n   node index.js\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Ensure `tshark` is in your PATH. WireMCP will auto-detect it or fall back to common install locations (e.g., `/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/tshark` on macOS).\n\n# Usage with MCP Clients\n\nWireMCP works with any MCP-compliant client. Below are examples for popular clients:\n\n## Example 1: Cursor\n\nEdit `mcp.json` in Cursor -> Settings -> MCP :\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"wiremcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/WireMCP/index.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Location (macOS)**: `/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n## Other Clients\n\nThis MCP will work well with any client. Use the command `node /path/to/WireMCP/index.js` in their MCP server settings.\n\n# Example Output\n\nRunning `check_threats` might yield:\n\n```\nCaptured IPs:\n174.67.0.227\n52.196.136.253\n\nThreat check against URLhaus blacklist:\nNo threats detected in URLhaus blacklist.\n```\n\nRunning `analyze_pcap` on a capture file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": [{\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"text\": \"Analyzed PCAP: ./capture.pcap\\n\\nUnique IPs:\\n192.168.0.2\\n192.168.0.1\\n\\nProtocols:\\neth:ethertype:ip:tcp\\neth:ethertype:ip:tcp:telnet\\n\\nPacket Data:\\n[{\\\"layers\\\":{\\\"frame.number\\\":[\\\"1\\\"],\\\"ip.src\\\":[\\\"192.168.0.2\\\"],\\\"ip.dst\\\":[\\\"192.168.0.1\\\"],\\\"tcp.srcport\\\":[\\\"1550\\\"],\\\"tcp.dstport\\\":[\\\"23\\\"]}}]\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n\nLLMs can use these outputs to:\n- Provide natural language explanations of network activity\n- Identify patterns and potential security concerns\n- Offer context-aware recommendations\n- Generate human-readable reports\n\n# Roadmap\n\n- **Expand IOC Providers**: Currently uses URLhaus for threat checks. Future updates will integrate additional sources (e.g., IPsum, Emerging Threats) for broader coverage.\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\n- Wireshark/tshark team for their excellent packet analysis tools\n- Model Context Protocol community for the framework and specifications\n- URLhaus for providing threat intelligence data",

experimentation, evaluation, and troubleshooting. It provides:\n\n- [**_Tracing_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces) - Trace your LLM application's runtime using OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation.\n- [**_Evaluation_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/evaluation/llm-evals) - Leverage LLMs to benchmark your application's performance using response and retrieval evals.\n- [**_Datasets_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/overview-datasets) - Create versioned datasets of examples for experimentation, evaluation, and fine-tuning.\n- [**_Experiments_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/datasets-and-experiments/overview-datasets#experiments) - Track and evaluate changes to prompts, LLMs, and retrieval.\n- [**_Playground_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/prompt-engineering/overview-prompts)- Optimize prompts, compare models, adjust parameters, and replay traced LLM calls.\n- [**_Prompt Management_**](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/prompt-engineering/overview-prompts/prompt-management)- Manage and test prompt changes systematically using version control, tagging, and experimentation.\n\nPhoenix is vendor and language agnostic with out-of-the-box support for popular frameworks (🦙[LlamaIndex](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex), 🦜⛓[LangChain](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/langchain), [Haystack](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/haystack), 🧩[DSPy](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/dspy), 🤗[smolagents](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/hfsmolagents)) and LLM providers ([OpenAI](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/openai), [Bedrock](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/bedrock), [MistralAI](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/mistralai), [VertexAI](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/vertexai), [LiteLLM](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/litellm), [Google GenAI](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/google-genai) and more). For details on auto-instrumentation, check out the [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) project.\n\nPhoenix runs practically anywhere, including your local machine, a Jupyter notebook, a containerized deployment, or in the cloud.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Phoenix via `pip` or `conda`\n\n```shell\npip install arize-phoenix\n```\n\nPhoenix container images are available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/arizephoenix/phoenix) and can be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes. Arize AI also provides cloud instances at [app.phoenix.arize.com](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/).\n\n## Packages\n\nThe `arize-phoenix` package includes the entire Phoenix platfom. However if you have deployed the Phoenix platform, there are light-weight Python sub-packages and TypeScript packages that can be used in conjunction with the platfrom.\n\n### Subpackages\n\n| Package                                                                                             | Version & Docs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Description                                                                                       |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [arize-phoenix-otel](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/packages/phoenix-otel)           | [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/arize-phoenix-otel)](https://pypi.org/project/arize-phoenix-otel/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=readthedocs&logoColor=white)](https://arize-phoenix.readthedocs.io/projects/otel/en/latest/index.html)       | Provides a lightweight wrapper around OpenTelemetry primitives with Phoenix-aware defaults        |\n| [arize-phoenix-client](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/packages/phoenix-client)       | [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/arize-phoenix-client)](https://pypi.org/project/arize-phoenix-client/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=readthedocs&logoColor=white)](https://arize-phoenix.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/index.html) | Lightweight client for interacting with the Phoenix server via its OpenAPI REST interface         |\n| [arize-phoenix-evals](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/packages/phoenix-evals)         | [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/arize-phoenix-evals)](https://pypi.org/project/arize-phoenix-evals/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=readthedocs&logoColor=white)](https://arize-phoenix.readthedocs.io/projects/evals/en/latest/index.html)    | Tooling to evaluate LLM applications including RAG relevance, answer relevance, and more          |\n| [@arizeai/phoenix-client](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/js/packages/phoenix-client) | [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40arizeai%2Fphoenix-client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arizeai/phoenix-client) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://arize-ai.github.io/phoenix/)                            | Client for the Arize Phoenix API                                                                  |\n| [@arizeai/phoenix-evals](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/js/packages/phoenix-evals)   | [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40arizeai%2Fphoenix-evals)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arizeai/phoenix-evals) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://arize-ai.github.io/phoenix/)                              | TypeScript evaluation library for LLM applications (alpha release)                                |\n| [@arizeai/phoenix-mcp](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/tree/main/js/packages/phoenix-mcp)       | [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40arizeai%2Fphoenix-mcp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arizeai/phoenix-mcp) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue?logo=markdown&logoColor=white)](./js/packages/phoenix-mcp/README.md)                                    | MCP server implementation for Arize Phoenix providing unified interface to Phoenix's capabilities |\n\n## Tracing Integrations\n\nPhoenix is built on top of OpenTelemetry and is vendor, language, and framework agnostic.

All the information gathered from the cluster is done by interacting\nwith the monitors using an appropriate wrapper over\n`rados_mon_command()`. Hence, no additional setup is necessary other than\nhaving a working Ceph cluster.\n\nA List of all the metrics collected is available on [METRICS.md](./METRICS.md) page.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nYou should ideally run this exporter from the client that can talk to the Ceph\ncluster. Like any other Ceph client, it needs the following files to run\ncorrectly.\n\n* `ceph.conf` containing your Ceph configuration.\n* `ceph.client.<user>.keyring` in order to authenticate to your Ceph cluster.\n\nThe `ceph_exporter` will automatically pick those up if they are present in\nany of the [default\nlocations](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/ceph-conf/#the-configuration-file). Otherwise\nyou will need to provide the configuration manually using environment\nvariables:\n\n* `CEPH_CLUSTER`: cluster's name (default `ceph`)\n* `CEPH_CONFIG`: configuration file that a Ceph client uses to connect to\n  the cluster (default `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf`)\n* `CEPH_USER`: a Ceph client user used to connect to the cluster (default\n  `admin`)\n\nWe use Ceph's [official Golang client](https://github.com/ceph/go-ceph) to run\ncommands on the cluster.\n\n`ceph_exporter` is currently in use and tested against Nautilus, Pacific, and Reef.\nIt might not work as expected with older or non-LTS versions of Ceph.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n| Name                    | Description                                                                                    | Default                  |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `TELEMETRY_ADDR`        | Host:Port for ceph_exporter's metrics endpoint                                                 | `*:9128`                 |\n| `TELEMETRY_PATH`        | URL Path for surfacing metrics to Prometheus                                                   | `/metrics`               |\n| `EXPORTER_CONFIG`       | Path to ceph_exporter configuration file                                                       | `/etc/ceph/exporter.yml` |\n| `RGW_MODE`              | Enable collection of stats from RGW (0:disabled 1:enabled 2:background)                        | `0`                      |\n| `CEPH_CLUSTER`          | Ceph cluster name                                                                              | `ceph`                   |\n| `CEPH_CONFIG`           | Path to Ceph configuration file                                                                | `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf`    |\n| `CEPH_USER`             | Ceph user to connect to cluster                                                                | `admin`                  |\n| `CEPH_RADOS_OP_TIMEOUT` | Ceph rados_osd_op_timeout and rados_mon_op_timeout used to contact cluster (0s means no limit) | `30s`                    |\n| `LOG_LEVEL`             | Logging level.

The port `9128`\nis exposed as a default port for `ceph_exporter`.\n\nThe exporter needs your Ceph configuration in order to establish communication\nwith the Ceph monitors. You can either pass it in as an additional command or\nmount the directory containing both your `ceph.conf` and your user's keyring\nunder the default `/etc/ceph` location that Ceph checks for.\n\nA sample build command would look like:\n\n```bash\n$ docker build -t digitalocean/ceph_exporter .\n```\n\nA `--build-args TEST=true` flag can be added to the build command above to\nalso run Golang's unit tests during build:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t digitalocean/ceph_exporter . --build-arg TEST=true --no-cache\n```\n\nYou can start running your `ceph_exporter` container now.\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -v /etc/ceph:/etc/ceph -p=9128:9128 -it digitalocean/ceph_exporter\n```\n\nYou would have to ensure your image can talk over to the monitors. If it needs\naccess to your host's network stack you might need to add `--net=host` to the\nabove command. It makes the port mapping redundant so the `-p` flag can be\nremoved.\n\nPoint your Prometheus to scrape from `:9128` on your host now (or your port\nof choice if you decide to change it).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more\ninformation on how to submit your changes to this repository.\n\n## Sample view\n\nSee `./examples` for a `docker-compose` file with Grafana if you'd like to\nquickly get a test environment up and running.\n\nLink to official documentation explaining `docker-compose`:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/compose/\n\nThe `docker-compose` file itself has comments on how to change it to adapt to\nyour environment. It does use volumes in order to persist data.

For example, to disable\nthe OnCall tools, use `--disable-oncall`.\n\n### Tools\n\n| Tool                              | Category    | Description                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `search_dashboards`               | Search      | Search for dashboards                                              |\n| `get_dashboard_by_uid`            | Dashboard   | Get a dashboard by uid                                             |\n| `list_datasources`                | Datasources | List datasources                                                   |\n| `get_datasource_by_uid`           | Datasources | Get a datasource by uid                                            |\n| `get_datasource_by_name`          | Datasources | Get a datasource by name                                           |\n| `query_prometheus`                | Prometheus  | Execute a query against a Prometheus datasource                    |\n| `list_prometheus_metric_metadata` | Prometheus  | List metric metadata                                               |\n| `list_prometheus_metric_names`    | Prometheus  | List available metric names                                        |\n| `list_prometheus_label_names`     | Prometheus  | List label names matching a selector                               |\n| `list_prometheus_label_values`    | Prometheus  | List values for a specific label                                   |\n| `list_incidents`                  | Incident    | List incidents in Grafana Incident                                 |\n| `create_incident`                 | Incident    | Create an incident in Grafana Incident                             |\n| `add_activity_to_incident`        | Incident    | Add an activity item to an incident in Grafana Incident            |\n| `resolve_incident`                | Incident    | Resolve an incident in Grafana Incident                            |\n| `query_loki_logs`                 | Loki        | Query and retrieve logs using LogQL (either log or metric queries) |\n| `list_loki_label_names`           | Loki        | List all available label names in logs                             |\n| `list_loki_label_values`          | Loki        | List values for a specific log label                               |\n| `query_loki_stats`                | Loki        | Get statistics about log streams                                   |\n| `list_alert_rules`                | Alerting    | List alert rules                                                   |\n| `get_alert_rule_by_uid`           | Alerting    | Get alert rule by UID                                              |\n| `list_oncall_schedules`           | OnCall      | List schedules from Grafana OnCall                                 |\n| `get_oncall_shift`                | OnCall      | Get details for a specific OnCall shift                           |\n| `get_current_oncall_users`        | OnCall      | Get users currently on-call for a specific schedule                |\n| `list_oncall_teams`               | OnCall      | List teams from Grafana OnCall                                     |\n| `list_oncall_users`               | OnCall      | List users from Grafana OnCall                                     |\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Create a service account in Grafana with enough permissions to use the tools you want to use,\n   generate a service account token, and copy it to the clipboard for use in the configuration file.\n   Follow the [Grafana documentation][service-account] for details.\n\n2. Download the latest release of `mcp-grafana` from the [releases page](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/releases) and place it in your `$PATH`.\n\n   If you have a Go toolchain installed you can also build and install it from source, using the `GOBIN` environment variable\n   to specify the directory where the binary should be installed. This should also be in your `PATH`.\n\n   ```bash\n   GOBIN=\"$HOME/go/bin\" go install github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana/cmd/mcp-grafana@latest\n   ```\n\n3. Add the server configuration to your client configuration file. For example, for Claude Desktop:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"grafana\": {\n         \"command\": \"mcp-grafana\",\n         \"args\": [],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"GRAFANA_URL\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n           \"GRAFANA_API_KEY\": \"<your service account token>\"\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n> Note: if you see `Error: spawn mcp-grafana ENOENT` in Claude Desktop, you need to specify the full path to `mcp-grafana`.\n\n### Debug Mode\n\nYou can enable debug mode for the Grafana transport by adding the `-debug` flag to the command. This will provide detailed logging of HTTP requests and responses between the MCP server and the Grafana API, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.\n\nTo use debug mode with the Claude Desktop configuration, update your config as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"grafana\": {\n      \"command\": \"mcp-grafana\",\n      \"args\": [\"-debug\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GRAFANA_URL\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n        \"GRAFANA_API_KEY\": \"<your service account token>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\nContributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.\n\nThis project is written in Go. Install Go following the instructions for your platform.\n\nTo run the server, use:\n\n```bash\nmake run\n```\n\nYou can also run the server using the SSE transport inside Docker. To build the image, use\n\n```\nmake build-image\n```\n\nAnd to run the image, use:\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 mcp-grafana:latest\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nThere are three types of tests available:\n\n1. Unit Tests (no external dependencies required):\n```bash\nmake test-unit\n```\n\nYou can also run unit tests with:\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\n2. Integration Tests (requires docker containers to be up and running):\n```bash\nmake test-integration\n```\n\n3. Cloud Tests (requires cloud Grafana instance and credentials):\n```bash\nmake test-cloud\n```\n> Note: Cloud tests are automatically configured in CI. For local development, you'll need to set up your own Grafana Cloud instance and credentials.\n\nMore comprehensive integration tests will require a Grafana instance to be running locally on port 3000; you can start one with Docker Compose:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThe integration tests can be run with:\n\n```bash\nmake test-all\n```\n\nIf you're adding more tools, please add integration tests for them. The existing tests should be a good starting point.\n\n### Linting\n\nTo lint the code, run:\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\nThis includes a custom linter that checks for unescaped commas in `jsonschema` struct tags. The commas in `description` fields must be escaped with `\\\\,` to prevent silent truncation. You can run just this linter with:\n\n```bash\nmake lint-jsonschema\n```\n\nSee the [JSONSchema Linter documentation](internal/linter/jsonschema/README.md) for more details.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).\n\n[mcp]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n[service-account]: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/service-accounts/\n",

This server enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to interact with your New Relic data.\n\n## Features\n\n- Query New Relic logs and metrics using NRQL\n- Detailed error logging\n- Easy integration with Claude Desktop\n- Human-readable output formatting\n- Configurable New Relic account ID\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- New Relic account and API key\n- Claude Desktop application\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. Install `uv` package manager:\n```bash\n# On macOS/Linux\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# On Windows (PowerShell)\npowershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\n2. Create and setup project:\n```bash\n# Create directory\nmkdir newrelic-mcp\ncd newrelic-mcp\n\n# Create virtual environment\nuv venv\n\n# Activate virtual environment\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\n\n# Install dependencies\nuv pip install \"mcp[cli]\" httpx\n```\n\n3. Create server file `newrelic_logs_server.py` with the provided code.\n\n4. Configure your environment variables:\n```bash\n# On Unix/macOS\nexport NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\nexport NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=\"your-account-id-here\"\n\n# On Windows (CMD)\nset NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\nset NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id-here\n\n# On Windows (PowerShell)\n$env:NEW_RELIC_API_KEY = \"your-api-key-here\"\n$env:NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID = \"your-account-id-here\"\n```\n\n### Claude Desktop Integration\n\nConfigure Claude Desktop by editing your configuration file:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nAdd the following configuration:\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"newrelic\": {\n            \"command\": \"uv\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"/absolute/path/to/newrelic-mcp\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"newrelic_logs_server.py\"\n            ],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"NEW_RELIC_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key-here\",\n                \"NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID\": \"your-account-id-here\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Example NRQL Queries\n\n1. Basic Transaction Query:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago\n```\n\n2. Error Analysis:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Transaction WHERE error IS TRUE SINCE 1 hour ago LIMIT 10\n```\n\n3. Performance Analysis:\n```sql\nSELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET name ORDER BY average(duration) DESC LIMIT 5\n```\n\n### Example Claude Prompts\n\nYou can ask Claude questions like:\n- \"Show me all transactions from the last hour\"\n- \"Are there any errors in our application?\"\n- \"What are our slowest endpoints?\"\n\n## Debugging\n\n### Viewing Logs\n\n```bash\n# On macOS/Linux\ntail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-newrelic.log\n\n# On Windows\ntype %APPDATA%\\Claude\\logs\\mcp-server-newrelic.log\n```\n\n### Testing with MCP Inspector\n\nTest your server functionality using:\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run newrelic_logs_server.py\n```\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. Authentication Errors:\n- Check if NEW_RELIC_API_KEY is set correctly\n- Verify API key has correct permissions\n- Ensure API key is valid\n\n2. Query Errors:\n- Verify NRQL syntax\n- Check account ID in code matches your account\n- Ensure queried data exists in the time range\n\n3. Connection Issues:\n- Check network connectivity\n- Verify GraphQL endpoint is accessible\n- Ensure no firewalls are blocking connections\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- Never commit API keys to version control\n- Use environment variables for sensitive data\n- Keep dependencies updated\n- Monitor query patterns and access logs\n\n## Development\n\n### Local Testing\n\n1. Set environment variables:\n```bash\nexport NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\nexport NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=\"your-account-id-here\"\n```\n\n2. Run the server:\n```bash\nuv run newrelic_logs_server.py\n```\n\n### Code Structure\n\nThe server implements:\n- Single NRQL query tool\n- Configurable New Relic account ID\n- Comprehensive error handling\n- Detailed logging\n- Response formatting\n\n### Testing Changes\n\n1. Modify code as needed\n2. Test with MCP Inspector\n3. Restart Claude Desktop to apply changes\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n1. Server Not Starting:\n- Check Python version\n- Verify all dependencies are installed\n- Ensure virtual environment is activated\n\n2.

Connect to your VPS via SSH: \n```bash\nssh root@your-vps-ip\n```\n\n2. Install required packages:\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nano git docker.io python3 python3-pip docker-compose\n```\n\n3. Configure firewall:\n```bash\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow 5678  # n8n (using port 5678 to avoid conflict with Supabase)\nsudo ufw allow 3001  # Flowise\nsudo ufw allow 8080  # Open WebUI\nsudo ufw allow 3000  # Grafana\nsudo ufw allow 80    # HTTP\nsudo ufw allow 443   # HTTPS\nsudo ufw allow 8000  # Supabase API (Kong)\nsudo ufw allow 11434 # Ollama\nsudo ufw allow 6333  # Qdrant\nsudo ufw allow 9090  # Prometheus\nsudo ufw allow 54321 # Supabase Studio\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n4. Clone the repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ThijsdeZeeuw/avg-kwintes.git\ncd avg-kwintes\n```\n\n5. Run the configuration script to prepare the environment:\n```bash\n# Make the script executable\nchmod +x fix_config.sh\n\n# Run the configuration script\nsudo ./fix_config.sh\n```\n\nThe configuration script will:\n- Check and install all necessary system dependencies\n- Configure the correct firewall rules for all services\n- Detect and resolve any port conflicts\n- Generate utility scripts for maintenance\n- Create a basic .env file if one doesn't exist\n\n6. Run the interactive setup to complete configuration:\n```bash\npython3 start_services.py --interactive\n```\n\n7. Start the services:\n```bash\npython3 start_services.py --profile cpu\n```\n\nThis sequence ensures that everything is properly configured before starting the services, avoiding port conflicts and other setup issues.\n\n## Utility Scripts\n\nThe configuration process creates several helpful utility scripts:\n\n### Update Script\nTo update your Local AI Stack to the latest version:\n```bash\nsudo ./update_stack.sh\n```\nThis script will pull the latest Docker images, apply necessary configuration fixes, and restart all services.\n\n### Backup Script\nTo create a complete backup of your Local AI Stack data:\n```bash\nsudo ./backup_stack.sh\n```\nThis script will back up all Docker volumes, configuration files, and secrets to a timestamped archive.\n\n## Ollama Models\n\nThe following models are automatically installed and available in the system:\n\n### Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\n| Model | Source | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| gemma3:12b | Google | A 12B parameter model from Google's Gemma family, optimized for general text understanding and generation |\n| granite3-guardian:8b | IBM | An 8B parameter model focused on safety and ethical considerations in AI interactions |\n| granite3.1-dense:latest | IBM | Latest version of IBM's dense transformer model for general language tasks |\n| granite3.1-moe:3b | IBM | A 3B parameter mixture-of-experts model optimized for efficient inference |\n| granite3.2:latest | IBM | Latest version of IBM's advanced language model with improved capabilities |\n| llama3.2-vision | Meta | A multimodal model capable of understanding both text and images |\n| minicpm-v:8b | OpenBMB | A compact 8B parameter model optimized for efficient deployment |\n| mistral-nemo:12b | Mistral AI | A 12B parameter model based on Mistral's architecture with enhanced capabilities |\n| qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M | Alibaba | A quantized 7B parameter instruction-tuned model optimized for efficiency |\n| reader-lm:latest | OpenBMB | A specialized model for document understanding and question answering |\n\n### Embedding Models\n\n| Model | Source | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| granite-embedding:278m | IBM | A compact embedding model for efficient text vectorization |\n| jeffh/intfloat-multilingual-e5-large-instruct:f16 | Hugging Face | A multilingual embedding model optimized for instruction following |\n| nomic-embed-text:latest | Nomic AI | A general-purpose text embedding model for semantic search and similarity |\n\nThese models are automatically downloaded during the initial setup process. The system supports both CPU and GPU (NVIDIA/AMD) inference depending on your hardware configuration.\n\n## Accessing Services\n\nAfter installation, you can access the following services:\n\n- n8n: https://n8n.kwintes.cloud\n- Web UI: https://openwebui.kwintes.cloud\n- Flowise: https://flowise.kwintes.cloud\n- Supabase: https://supabase.kwintes.cloud\n- Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54321 or https://studio.supabase.kwintes.cloud\n- Grafana: https://grafana.kwintes.cloud\n- Prometheus: https://prometheus.kwintes.cloud\n- Whisper API: https://whisper.kwintes.cloud\n- Qdrant API: https://qdrant.kwintes.cloud\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe stack includes comprehensive monitoring:\n\n1. Access Grafana at https://grafana.kwintes.cloud\n   - Default credentials: admin / (password from secrets.txt)\n   - Add Prometheus as a data source (URL: http://prometheus:9090)\n\n2. Access Prometheus at https://prometheus.kwintes.cloud\n   - View metrics and create alerts\n\n## Security Notes\n\n1. All secrets are saved to secrets.txt - keep this file secure\n2. All services are configured to use HTTPS through Caddy\n3. Firewall rules are configured to allow only necessary ports\n4. Default credentials should be changed after first login\n\n## Maintenance\n\nTo update the stack:\n```bash\ncd local-ai-packaged\ngit pull\npython3 start_services.py --profile cpu\n```\n\nTo restart services:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p localai down\npython3 start_services.py --profile cpu\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Docker Compose Issues**\n   \n   If you encounter errors with Docker Compose commands like:\n   ```\n   unknown shorthand flag: 'p' in -p\n   ```\n   This indicates incompatibility between the command format and your Docker Compose version.\n   \n   **Solution:** The script now automatically detects and uses the correct Docker Compose command format for your system. If you're manually running commands, use:\n   - For Docker Compose plugin: `docker compose -p localai ...` \n   - For standalone binary: `docker-compose -p localai ...`\n   \n   If neither works, install the standalone Docker Compose binary:\n   ```bash\n   sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n   ```\n\n2. Check service logs:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p localai logs -f [service_name]\n# or\ndocker-compose -p localai logs -f [service_name]\n```\n\n3. Verify service status:\n```bash\ndocker compose -p localai ps\n# or\ndocker-compose -p localai ps\n```\n\n4. Check monitoring:\n- Visit Grafana dashboard\n- Check Prometheus targets\n- Review service health endpoints\n\n5. Service Restart:\n```bash\n# Restart all services\ndocker compose down\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues and feature requests, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.\n\n---\nCreated and maintained by Z4Y\n\n## Security Features\n\nThis setup prioritizes security through multiple layers:\n\n1. **Local Deployment**\n   - All AI models run locally on your VPS\n   - No data is sent to external AI services\n   - Complete control over data privacy and security\n\n2. **Secure Infrastructure**\n   - Automatic HTTPS/TLS encryption via Caddy\n   -

      "readme_content": "# MCP Terminal Server\n\nMCP Terminal Server provides terminal access and system tools via a clean web interface. It enables remote command execution, directory listing, and other terminal operations through a simple HTTP server.\n\n![MCP Terminal Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yaswanth-ampolu/smithery-mcp-server/main/screenshots/terminal-server.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- 🚀 **Remote Terminal Access**: Execute shell commands from a web browser\n- 📁 **Directory Listing**: Browse and list files in any directory\n- 🔒 **Secure Local Installation**: Runs without requiring root access\n- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Clean, modern UI for easy interaction\n- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: See command outputs as they happen\n- 🛠️ **Easy Management**: Simple commands to start, stop, and manage the server\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing the MCP Terminal Server, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)\n- **curl** (for downloading the installation script)\n- **tar** (for extracting the package)\n\n## Quick Installation\n\nInstall the MCP Terminal Server with a single command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -o- https://github.com/Yaswanth-ampolu/smithery-mcp-server/raw/main/main/install-mcp.sh | bash\n```\n\nThis will:\n1. Download the installation script\n2. Check for dependencies\n3. Download and extract the server files\n4. Set up the necessary directories\n5. Add the command to your PATH\n\n## Manual Installation\n\nIf you prefer to inspect the script before running it:\n\n1. Download the installation script:\n   ```bash\n   curl -o install-mcp.sh https://github.com/Yaswanth-ampolu/smithery-mcp-server/raw/main/main/install-mcp.sh\n   ```\n\n2. Review the script content:\n   ```bash\n   less install-mcp.sh\n   ```\n\n3. Run the installation:\n   ```bash\n   bash install-mcp.sh\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation, the MCP Terminal Server can be managed with the following commands:\n\n### Starting the Server\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal start\n```\n\nBy default, the server starts on port 8080. To use a different port:\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal start --port 9000\n```\n\n### Stopping the Server\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal stop\n```\n\n### Checking Server Status\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal status\n```\n\nThis shows:\n- Whether the server is running\n- The PID of the running server\n- Memory usage\n- The URL to access the web interface\n\n### Restarting the Server\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal restart\n```\n\n### Uninstalling\n\nTo completely remove the MCP Terminal Server:\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal uninstall\n```\n\n## Web Interface\n\nOnce the server is running, access the web interface at:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080\n```\n\n(or the custom port you specified)\n\nThe web interface provides:\n- A command execution tool\n- A directory listing tool\n- Real-time output display\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe MCP Terminal Server stores its files in:\n- `~/mcp-terminal` - Main installation directory\n- `~/bin/mcp-terminal` - Command script\n\nLog files and PID information are stored in:\n- `~/mcp-terminal/mcp.log` - Server log file\n- `~/mcp-terminal/mcp.pid` - Server PID file\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Server Won't Start\n\nIf the server fails to start:\n\n1. Check if Node.js is installed and version 14+:\n   ```bash\n   node -v\n   ```\n\n2. Check the log file for errors:\n   ```bash\n   tail -n 50 ~/mcp-terminal/mcp.log\n   ```\n\n3. Verify the installation directory exists:\n   ```bash\n   ls -la ~/mcp-terminal\n   ```\n\n### Port Already in Use\n\nIf the default port (8080) is already in use:\n\n```bash\nmcp-terminal start --port 9000\n```\n\n### Missing Command\n\nIf the `mcp-terminal` command is not found:\n\n1. Ensure `~/bin` is in your PATH:\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n\n2. If not, add it manually:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n3. For permanent addition, add to your shell configuration:\n   ```bash\n   echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- The MCP Terminal Server executes commands with the same permissions as the user who started it\n- It's recommended to run the server on a local network or behind a firewall\n- Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication for public-facing deployments\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, questions, or feedback, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yaswanth-ampolu/smithery-mcp-server/issues).

Download Claude Desktop [here](https://claude.ai/download).\n2. Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"system-resource-monitor\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/absolute/path/to/dist/index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAccess the config file:\n\n```bash\nvim ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n*(Adjust the path to `dist/index.js` based on your project location.)*\n\n\n\n### Step 4: Testing\n\nEnsure Claude Desktop recognizes the tools by checking for the hammer icon:\n\n![Claude Visual Tools](assets/hammer-mcp.png)\n\nClick the hammer icon to see available tools:\n\n![Available Integration](assets/tools-mcp.png)\n\nIf all six tools (`get_cpu_usage`, `get_memory_usage`, etc.) appear, the integration is active. You can now ask questions like:\n- \"What’s my CPU usage?\"\n- \"How fast is my internet?\"\n\n### Step 5: Advanced Customization\n\n- **Internet Speed Test**: Modify `testUrls` in `index.ts` to use different download sources or adjust `uploadSizeBytes` (default 80KB) for upload tests.\n- **Logging**: Console logs provide detailed test output; disable them in production by removing `console.log` statements.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Tool Not Showing**: Verify the server is running (`node dist/index.js`) and the config path is correct.\n- **Internet Speed Errors**: Ensure network connectivity and test URLs are accessible. Check console logs for specific failures.\n- Refer to the [MCP troubleshooting guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging)\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.

      "readme_content": "# stdout-mcp-server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that captures and manages stdout logs through a named pipe system. This server is particularly useful for:\n- Capturing logs from multiple processes or applications and making them available for debugging in Cursor IDE.\n- Monitoring application output in real-time and providing a MCP interface to query, filter, and analyze logs\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. The server creates a named pipe at a specific location (`/tmp/stdout_pipe` on Unix/MacOS or `\\\\.\\pipe\\stdout_pipe` on Windows)\n\n2. Any application can write logs to this pipe using standard output redirection. For example:\n```bash\nyour_application | tee /tmp/stdout_pipe # or\nyour_application > /tmp/stdout_pipe\n```\n3. The server monitors the pipe, captures all incoming logs, and maintains a history of the last 100 entries\n\n4. Through MCP tools, you can query, filter, and analyze these logs\n\n## System Requirements\n\nBefore installing, please ensure you have:\n\n* Node.js v18 or newer\n\n## Installation Options\n\n### Option 1: Installation in Cursor\n\n1. Open Cursor and navigate to `Cursor > Settings > MCP Servers`\n2. Click on \"Add new MCP Server\"\n3.

Cursor's Agent can then call these tools to retrieve specific pieces of information.\n5.  **Markdown Output (Optional):** The server can optionally generate a Markdown file (`development_environment_info.md`) containing all the collected information for easier review and debugging.\n6.  **Cursor Integration:** Cursor, acting as an MCP client, can connect to this server and automatically utilize the provided tools to enhance its understanding of your development context.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install and run this MCP server, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/carterlasalle/system_information_mcp.git\n    cd system_information_mcp\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv venv\n    ```\n\n3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n    *   **On Linux/macOS:**\n        ```bash\n        source venv/bin/activate\n        ```\n    *   **On Windows:**\n        ```bash\n        venv\\Scripts\\activate\n        ```\n\n4.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n## Configuration for Cursor\n\nTo connect this MCP server to Cursor, you need to configure it within Cursor's settings:\n\n1.  **Open Cursor Settings:** Go to `Cursor Settings` > `Features` > `MCP`.\n2.  **Add New MCP Server:** Click on the `+ Add New MCP Server` button.\n3.  **Configure Server:** Fill in the form with the following details:\n    *   **Type:** `stdio`\n    *   **Name:** `DevEnvInfoServer` (or any name you prefer)\n    *   **Command:**  Enter the command to run the server. If you are in the `system_information_mcp` directory and have activated the virtual environment, you can use:\n        ```bash\n        python claudemcp.py\n        ```\n        **Note:** If `python` is not in your system's PATH or you are using a specific Python executable, you may need to provide the full path to your Python interpreter followed by the path to `claudemcp.py`. For example:\n        ```bash\n        /path/to/your/python venv/bin/python claudemcp.py\n        ```\n4.  **Add Server:** Click the \"Add Server\" button.\n5.  **Refresh Tool List (Optional):** You might need to manually press the refresh button in the top right corner of the MCP server list in Cursor to populate the tool list.\n\nThe server `DevEnvInfoServer` should now appear in your list of MCP servers in Cursor, and its tools should be available to the Agent in Composer.\n\n## Usage in Cursor\n\nOnce configured, Cursor's Agent will automatically leverage the tools provided by `DevEnvInfoServer` when it deems them relevant to your requests.\n\n*   **Automatic Tool Usage:**  When you interact with Cursor's Agent in Composer, it will intelligently decide if information about your development environment is needed to answer your questions or fulfill your requests. If so, it will automatically use the tools provided by this server in the background.\n*   **Intentional Tool Prompting:** You can also explicitly instruct the Agent to use these tools by referring to them by name or description in your prompts. For example, you could ask:\n    *   \"What Python packages are installed in my current environment?\"\n    *   \"List the available shells on my system using the DevEnvInfoServer tools.\"\n*   **Tool Approval:** By default, Cursor will ask for your approval before executing any MCP tool. You can review the tool call arguments before approving.\n*   **YOLO Mode (Optional):** If you prefer automatic tool execution without approval prompts, you can enable \"YOLO Mode\" in Cursor's MCP settings. Use this mode with caution, as it allows automatic execution of MCP tools.\n\nCursor will display the responses from the `DevEnvInfoServer` tools directly in the chat, providing you with the requested development environment information.\n",

Start the Prometheus stack using Docker Compose:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nThis will start:\n- Prometheus server (accessible at http://localhost:9090)\n- Node Exporter (for host metrics)\n- cAdvisor (for container metrics)\n\n2. For stress testing, you can start the memory stress container:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d --build memory-stress\n```\n\nOr use the container test script:\n```bash\n./scripts/container-memory-test.sh start\n```\n\n### Docker Configuration and Reset Scripts\n\nThis project includes multiple Docker configurations and reset scripts for reliable operation across different environments:\n\n#### Docker Configurations\n- **Standard Configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`): Uses custom Dockerfiles for Prometheus and Langflow to ensure consistent permissions across systems.\n- **Bridge Network Configuration** (`docker-compose.bridge.yml`): Alternative configuration that uses bridge networking for environments where host networking is problematic.\n\n#### Custom Dockerfiles for Solving Permission Issues\nThe project uses custom Dockerfiles for both Prometheus and Langflow to solve common permission issues:\n\n- **Dockerfile.prometheus**: Sets up the Prometheus configuration with proper permissions for the `nobody` user.\n- **Dockerfile.langflow**: Copies the components directory into the container without changing file ownership, allowing Langflow to access the components without permission errors.\n\nThis approach eliminates the need for volume mounts that can lead to permission conflicts across different machines and user configurations.\n\n#### Reset Scripts\n- **All Services Reset** (`reset-all.sh`): Reset all containers with a single command.\n  ```bash\n  # Basic reset (rebuilds containers with existing volumes)\n  ./reset-all.sh\n  \n  # Full reset (removes volumes and rebuilds containers)\n  ./reset-all.sh --clean\n  ```\n\n- **Individual Service Reset**:\n  ```bash\n  # Reset only Prometheus\n  ./reset-prometheus.sh\n  \n  # Reset only Langflow\n  ./reset-langflow.sh\n  ```\n\nThese scripts ensure that the containers are properly configured with correct permissions and the latest code changes.\n\n#### Troubleshooting\nIf you encounter permission issues:\n1. Use the reset scripts to rebuild the containers\n2. Check the logs with `docker compose logs <service_name>`\n3. Make sure any components added to Langflow are included in the Dockerfile.langflow\n\n#### Cross-Machine Deployment\nWhen deploying to a new machine:\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Make reset scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`\n3. Run the reset script: `./reset-all.sh`\n\nThe custom Dockerfiles automatically handle all permission issues that might occur across different systems.\n\n### Using Prometheus Client\n\nThe `MCPAIComponent` class includes Prometheus capabilities:\n\n```python\nfrom langflow import MCPAIComponent\n\n# Initialize the client\nmcp = MCPAIComponent(mcp_server_url=\"http://localhost:8000\")\n\n# Instant query (current metric values)\nresult = mcp.prometheus_query(\"up\")\n\n# Range query (metrics over time)\nresult = mcp.prometheus_query_range(\n    query=\"rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode='system'}[1m])\",\n    start=\"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n    end=\"2023-03-01T01:00:00Z\",\n    step=\"15s\"\n)\n\n# Get all labels\nlabels = mcp.prometheus_get_labels()\n\n# Get label values\nvalues = mcp.prometheus_get_label_values(\"job\")\n\n# Get targets\ntargets = mcp.prometheus_get_targets()\n\n# Get alerts\nalerts = mcp.prometheus_get_alerts()\n```\n\n### Useful PromQL Queries\n\n- CPU Usage: `rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}[1m])`\n- Memory Usage: `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes -

Please mind that these prompts lead to executing DQL statements which may incur [costs](#costs) in accordance to your licence.\n\n## Architecture\n\n![Architecture](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp/blob/main/assets/dynatrace-mcp-arch.png?raw=true)\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Real-time observability** - Fetch production-level data for early detection and proactive monitoring\n- **Contextual debugging** - Fix issues with full context from monitored exceptions, logs, and anomalies\n- **Security insights** - Get detailed vulnerability analysis and security problem tracking\n- **Natural language queries** - Use AI-powered DQL generation and explanation\n- **Multi-phase incident investigation** - Systematic 4-phase approach with automated impact assessment\n- **Advanced transaction analysis** - Precise root cause identification with file/line-level accuracy\n- **Cross-data source correlation** - Connect problems → spans → logs with trace ID correlation\n- **DevOps automation** - Deployment health gates with automated promotion/rollback logic\n- **Security compliance monitoring** - Multi-cloud compliance assessment with evidence-based investigation\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- List and get [problem](https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/problems/) details from your services (for example Kubernetes)\n- List and get security problems / [vulnerability](https://www.dynatrace.com/hub/detail/vulnerabilities/) details\n- Execute DQL (Dynatrace Query Language) and retrieve logs, events, spans and metrics\n- Send Slack messages (via Slack Connector)\n- Set up notification Workflow (via Dynatrace [AutomationEngine](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/automationengine))\n- Get more information about a monitored entity\n- Get Ownership of an entity\n\n### Costs\n\n**Important:** While this local MCP server is provided for free, using certain capabilities to access data in Dynatrace Grail may incur additional costs based\non your Dynatrace consumption model. This affects `execute_dql` tool and other capabilities that **query** Dynatrace Grail storage, and costs\ndepend on the volume (GB scanned).\n\n**Before using this MCP server extensively, please:**\n\n1. Review your current Dynatrace consumption model and pricing\n2. Understand the cost implications of the specific data you plan to query (logs, events, metrics) - see [Dynatrace Pricing and Rate Card](https://www.dynatrace.com/pricing/)\n3. Start with smaller timeframes (e.g., 12h-24h) and make use of [buckets](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/grail/data-model#built-in-grail-buckets) to reduce the cost impact\n4. Set an appropriate `DT_GRAIL_QUERY_BUDGET_GB` environment variable (default: 1000 GB) to control and monitor your Grail query consumption\n\n**Grail Budget Tracking:**\n\nThe MCP server includes built-in budget tracking for Grail queries to help you monitor and control costs:\n\n- Set `DT_GRAIL_QUERY_BUDGET_GB` (default: 1000 GB) to define your session budget limit\n- The server tracks bytes scanned across all Grail queries in the current session\n- You'll receive warnings when approaching 80% of your budget\n- Budget exceeded alerts help prevent unexpected high consumption\n- Budget resets when you restart the MCP server session\n\n**To understand costs that occured:**\n\nExecute the following DQL statement in a notebook to see how much bytes have been queried from Grail (Logs, Events, etc...):\n\n```\nfetch dt.system.events\n| filter event.kind == \"QUERY_EXECUTION_EVENT\" and contains(client.client_context, \"dynatrace-mcp\")\n| sort timestamp desc\n| fields timestamp, query_id, query_string, scanned_bytes, table, bucket, user.id, user.email, client.client_context\n| maketimeSeries sum(scanned_bytes), by: { user.email, user.id, table }\n```\n\n### AI-Powered Assistance (Preview)\n\n- **Natural Language to DQL** - Convert plain English queries to Dynatrace Query Language\n- **DQL Explanation** - Get plain English explanations of complex DQL queries\n- **AI Chat Assistant** - Get contextual help and guidance for Dynatrace questions\n- **Feedback System** - Provide feedback to improve AI responses over time\n\n> **Note:** While Davis CoPilot AI is generally available (GA), the Davis CoPilot APIs are currently in preview.

Alternatively, this can also be stored in user-settings, and you can define `env` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"npx-dynatrace-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN\": \"\",\n        \"DT_ENVIRONMENT\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Claude Desktop**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dynatrace-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN\": \"\",\n        \"DT_ENVIRONMENT\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Amazon Q Developer CLI**\n\nThe [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-mcp-configuration.html) provides an interactive chat experience directly in your terminal. You can ask questions, get help with AWS services, troubleshoot issues, and generate code snippets without leaving your command line environment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dynatrace-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN\": \"\",\n        \"DT_ENVIRONMENT\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration should be stored in `<your-repo>/.amazonq/mcp.json`.\n\n**Google Gemini CLI**\n\nThe [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) is Google's official command-line AI assistant that supports MCP server integration. You can add the Dynatrace MCP server using either the built-in management commands or manual configuration.\n\nUsing `gemini` CLI directly (recommended):\n\n```bash\ngemini extensions install https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp\nexport DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN=...\nexport DT_ENVIRONMENT=https://...\n```\n\nand verify that the server is running via\n\n```bash\ngemini mcp list\n```\n\nOr manually in your `~/.gemini/settings.json` or `.gemini/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dynatrace\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN\": \"\",\n        \"DT_ENVIRONMENT\": \"\"\n      },\n      \"timeout\": 30000,\n      \"trust\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### HTTP Server Mode (Alternative)\n\nFor scenarios where you need to run the MCP server as an HTTP service instead of using stdio (e.g., for stateful sessions, load balancing, or integration with web clients), you can use the HTTP server mode:\n\n**Running as HTTP server:**\n\n```bash\n# Get help and see all available options\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --help\n\n# Run with HTTP server on default port 3000\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --http\n\n# Run with custom port (using short or long flag)\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --server -p 8080\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --http --port 3001\n\n# Run with custom host/IP (using short or long flag)\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --http --host 127.0.0.1\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --http -H 192.168.0.1\n\n# Check version\nnpx -y @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest --version\n```\n\n**Configuration for MCP clients that support HTTP transport:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dynatrace-http\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n      \"transport\": \"http\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Rule File\n\nFor efficient result retrieval from Dynatrace, please consider creating a rule file (e.g., [.github/copilot-instructions.md](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions), [.amazonq/rules/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/context-project-rules.html)), instructing coding agents on how to get more details for your component/app/service. Here is an example for [easytrade](https://github.com/Dynatrace/easytrade), please adapt the names and filters to fit your use-cases and components:\n\n```\n# Observability\n\nWe use Dynatrace as an Observability solution. This document provides instructions on how to get data for easytrade from Dynatrace using DQL.\n\n## How to get any data for my App\n\nDepending on the query and tool used, the following filters can be applied to narrow down results:\n\n* `contains(entity.name, \"easytrade\")`\n* `contains(affected_entity.name, \"easytrade\")`\n* `contains(container.name, \"easytrade\")`\n\nFor best results, you can combine these filters with an `OR` operator.\n\n## Logs\n\nTo fetch logs for easytrade, execute `fetch logs | filter contains(container.name, \"easyatrade\")`.\nFor fetching just error-logs, add `| filter loglevel == \"ERROR\"`.\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nYou can set up authentication via **Platform Tokens** (recommended) or **OAuth Client** via the following environment variables:\n\n- `DT_ENVIRONMENT` (string, e.g., `https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com`) - URL to your Dynatrace Platform (do not use Dynatrace classic URLs like `abc12345.live.dynatrace.com`)\n- `DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN` (string, e.g., `dt0s16.SAMPLE.abcd1234`) - **Recommended**: Dynatrace Platform Token\n- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (string, e.g., `dt0s02.SAMPLE`) - Alternative: Dynatrace OAuth Client ID (for advanced use cases)\n- `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (string, e.g., `dt0s02.SAMPLE.abcd1234`) - Alternative: Dynatrace OAuth Client Secret (for advanced use cases)\n- `DT_GRAIL_QUERY_BUDGET_GB` (number, default: `1000`) - Budget limit in GB (base 1000) for Grail query bytes scanned per session. The MCP server tracks your Grail usage and warns when approaching or exceeding this limit.\n\n**Platform Tokens are recommended** for most use cases as they provide a simpler authentication flow. OAuth Clients should only be used when specific OAuth features are required.\n\nFor more information, please have a look at the documentation about\n[creating a Platform Token in Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/platform-tokens), as well as\n[creating an OAuth Client in Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/oauth-clients) for advanced scenarios.\n\nIn addition, depending on the features you use, the following variables can be configured:\n\n- `SLACK_CONNECTION_ID` (string) - connection ID of a [Slack Connection](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/actions/slack)\n\n### Scopes for Authentication\n\nDepending on the features you are using, the following scopes are needed:\n\n**Available for both Platform Tokens and OAuth Clients:**\n\n- `app-engine:apps:run` - needed for almost all tools\n- `app-engine:functions:run` - needed for for almost all tools\n- `environment-api:entities:read` - for retrieving ownership details from monitored entities (_currently not available for Platform Tokens_)\n- `automation:workflows:read` - read Workflows\n- `automation:workflows:write` - create and update Workflows\n- `automation:workflows:run` - run Workflows\n- `storage:buckets:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read all system data stored on Grail\n- `storage:logs:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read logs for reliability guardian validations\n- `storage:metrics:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read metrics for reliability guardian validations\n- `storage:bizevents:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read bizevents for reliability guardian validations\n- `storage:spans:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read spans from Grail\n- `storage:entities:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read Entities from Grail\n- `storage:events:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read Events from Grail\n- `storage:security.events:read`- needed for `execute_dql` tool to read Security Events from Grail\n- `storage:system:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read System Data from Grail\n- `storage:user.events:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read User events from Grail\n- `storage:user.sessions:read` - needed for `execute_dql` tool to read User sessions from Grail\n- `davis-copilot:conversations:execute` - execute conversational skill (chat with Copilot)\n- `davis-copilot:nl2dql:execute` - execute Davis Copilot Natural Language (NL) to DQL skill\n- `davis-copilot:dql2nl:execute` - execute DQL to Natural Language (NL) skill\n- `email:emails:send` - needed for `send_email` tool to send emails\n- `settings:objects:read` - needed for reading ownership information and Guardians (SRG) from settings\n\n  **Note**: Please ensure that `settings:objects:read` is used, and _not_ the similarly named scope `app-settings:objects:read`.\n\n**Important**: Some features requiring `environment-api:entities:read` will only work with OAuth Clients. For most use cases, Platform Tokens provide all necessary functionality.\n\n## ✨ Example prompts ✨\n\nUse these example prompts as a starting point. Just copy them into your IDE or agent setup, adapt them to your services/stack/architecture,\nand extend them as needed. They're here to help you imagine how real-time observability and automation work together in the MCP context in your IDE.\n\n### **Basic Queries & AI Assistance**\n\n**Find a monitored entity**\n\n```\nGet all details of the entity 'my-service'\n```\n\n**Find error logs**\n\n```\nShow me error logs\n```\n\n**Write a DQL query from natural language:**\n\n```\nShow me error rates for the payment service in the last hour\n```\n\n**Explain a DQL query:**\n\n```\nWhat does this DQL do?\nfetch logs | filter dt.source_entity == 'SERVICE-123' | summarize count(), by:{severity} | sort count() desc\n```\n\n**Chat with Davis CoPilot:**\n\n```\nHow can I investigate slow database queries in Dynatrace?\n```\n\n**Send email notifications:**\n\n```\nSend an email notification about the incident to the responsible team at team@example.com with CC to manager@example.com\n```\n\n### **Advanced Incident Investigation**\n\n**Multi-phase incident response:**\n\n```\nOur checkout service is experiencing high error rates.

Please ensure that you have added all required scopes as listed above.\n\n**For Platform Tokens:**\n\n1. Verify your Platform Token has all the necessary scopes listed in the \"Scopes for Authentication\" section\n2. Ensure your token is valid and not expired\n3. Check that your user has the required permissions in your Dynatrace Environment\n\n**For OAuth Clients:**\nIn case of OAuth-related problems, you can troubleshoot SSO/OAuth issues based on our [Dynatrace Developer Documentation](https://developer.dynatrace.com/develop/access-platform-apis-from-outside/#get-bearer-token-and-call-app-function).\n\nIt is recommended to test access with the following API (which requires minimal scopes `app-engine:apps:run` and `app-engine:functions:run`):\n\n1. Use OAuth Client ID and Secret to retrieve a Bearer Token (only valid for a couple of minutes):\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST 'https://sso.dynatrace.com/sso/oauth2/token' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'client_id={your-client-id}' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'client_secret={your-client-secret}' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'scope=app-engine:apps:run app-engine:functions:run'\n```\n\n2. Use `access_token` from the response of the above call as the bearer-token in the next call:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com/platform/management/v1/environment \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {your-bearer-token}'\n```\n\n3. You should retrieve a result like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentId\": \"abc12345\",\n  \"createTime\": \"2023-01-01T00:10:57.123Z\",\n  \"blockTime\": \"2025-12-07T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"state\": \"ACTIVE\"\n}\n```\n\n### Problem accessing data on Grail\n\nGrail has a dedicated section about permissions in the Dynatrace Docs. Please refer to https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/grail/data-model/assign-permissions-in-grail for more details.\n\n## Telemetry\n\nThe Dynatrace MCP Server includes sending Telemetry Data via Dynatrace OpenKit to help improve the product. This includes:\n\n- Server start events\n- Tool usage (which tools are called, success/failure, execution duration)\n- Error tracking for debugging and improvement\n\n**Privacy and Opt-out:**\n\n- Telemetry is **enabled by default** but can be disabled by setting `DT_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`\n- No sensitive data from your Dynatrace environment is tracked\n- Only anonymous usage statistics and error information are collected\n- Usage statistics and error data are transmitted to Dynatrace’s analytics endpoint\n\n**Configuration options:**\n\n- `DT_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` (boolean, default: `false`) - Disable Telemetry\n- `DT_MCP_TELEMETRY_APPLICATION_ID` (string, default: `dynatrace-mcp-server`) - Application ID for tracking\n- `DT_MCP_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT_URL` (string, default: Dynatrace endpoint) - OpenKit endpoint URL\n- `DT_MCP_TELEMETRY_DEVICE_ID` (string, default: auto-generated) - Device identifier for tracking\n\nTo disable usage tracking, add this to your environment:\n\n```bash\nDT_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true\n```\n",

Clone or download this repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-status-observer\ncd mcp-status-observer\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Build the project:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Running the MCP Server\n\nThere are two ways to run the MCP server:\n\n### Option 1: Running manually\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the server directly:\n\n```bash\nnode build/index.js\n```\n\nKeep this terminal window open while using Claude Desktop. The server will run until you close the terminal.\n\n### Option 2: Auto-starting with Claude Desktop (recommended for regular use)\n\nThe Claude Desktop can automatically start the MCP server when needed. To set this up:\n\n#### Configuration\n\nThe Claude Desktop configuration file is located at:\n\n- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nEdit this file to add the Status Observer MCP configuration. If the file doesn't exist, create it:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"statusObserver\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-status-observer/build/index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: Replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY` with the **complete absolute path** where you installed the MCP\n  - macOS/Linux example: `/Users/username/mcp-status-observer`\n  - Windows example: `C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\mcp-status-observer`\n\nIf you already have other MCPs configured, simply add the \"statusObserver\" section inside the \"mcpServers\" object. Here's an example of a configuration with multiple MCPs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"otherMcp1\": {\n      \"command\": \"...\",\n      \"args\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    \"otherMcp2\": {\n      \"command\": \"...\",\n      \"args\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    \"statusObserver\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DIRECTORY/mcp-status-observer/build/index.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe MCP server will automatically start when Claude Desktop needs it, based on the configuration in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Restart Claude Desktop after modifying the configuration\n2. In Claude, use the `status` command to interact with the Status Observer MCP Server\n3. The MCP server runs as a subprocess managed by Claude Desktop\n\n## Available Commands\n\nThe Status Observer MCP provides a single tool named `status` with several commands:\n\n| Command | Description | Parameters | Example |\n|---------|-------------|------------|---------|\n| `list` | List all available platforms | None | `status list` |\n| `--[platform]` | Get status for a specific platform | Platform name | `status --openrouter` |\n| `--all` | Get status for all platforms | None | `status --all` |\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThe Status Observer monitors 22 major digital platforms across various categories:\n\n### AI & Machine Learning (4)\n- **OpenRouter** - AI model routing and access platform\n- **OpenAI** - Leading AI services provider (ChatGPT, DALL-E, API)\n- **Anthropic** - AI assistant provider (Claude)\n- **Gemini** - Google's multimodal AI platform\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure (4)\n- **Google Cloud Platform** - Comprehensive cloud computing services\n- **DigitalOcean** - Developer-focused cloud infrastructure\n- **Vercel** - Frontend deployment and edge platform\n- **Netlify** - Web development and deployment platform\n\n### Developer Tools & Platforms (5)\n- **Docker** - Container platform and services\n- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration platform\n- **npm** - JavaScript package manager and registry\n- **Atlassian** - Developer collaboration tools (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence)\n- **Supabase** - Open source backend platform (PostgreSQL, auth, storage)\n\n### Productivity & Collaboration (5)\n- **LinkedIn** - Professional networking platform\n- **Slack** - Business communication and collaboration\n- **Asana** - Team workflow and project management\n- **Dropbox** - Cloud file storage and collaboration\n- **X (Twitter)** - Social media and real-time communication\n\n### Web Infrastructure & Security (3)\n- **Cloudflare** - Web infrastructure, CDN, and security\n- **Discord** - Developer community and communication platform\n- **Reddit** - Social news and developer community platform\n\n### Analytics & Business Tools (1)\n- **Amplitude** - Product analytics platform\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere are various examples of how to use the Status Observer with Claude:\n\n### Direct Commands:\n\n```\n# AI Platforms\nstatus --openrouter\nstatus --openai\nstatus --anthropic\nstatus --gemini\n\n# Cloud Infrastructure\nstatus --gcp\nstatus --vercel\nstatus --digitalocean\nstatus --netlify\n\n# Developer Tools\nstatus --docker\nstatus --github\nstatus --atlassian\nstatus --supabase\nstatus --npm\n\n# Productivity & Social\nstatus --linkedin\nstatus --slack\nstatus --x\nstatus --dropbox\n\n# Web Infrastructure\nstatus --cloudflare\nstatus --discord\n\n# All platforms\nstatus --all\nstatus list\n```\n\n### Preview\n![OpenRouter Status Monitoring Preview](https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-status-observer/raw/main/public/assets/openrouter.png)\n![GCP Status Monitoring Preview](https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-status-observer/raw/main/public/assets/gcp.png)\n\n### Natural Language Prompts:\n\nYou can also interact with the MCP using natural language. Claude will interpret these requests and use the appropriate commands:\n\n- \"Could you check if OpenRouter is having any API issues right now?\"\n- \"What's the status of OpenAI's ChatGPT service?\"\n- \"Has there been any recent incidents with Claude or the Anthropic API?\"\n- \"Is Google Cloud Platform experiencing any outages in my region?\"\n- \"Check if Docker Hub is operational for automated builds\"\n- \"What's the current status of LinkedIn's Sales Navigator?\"\n- \"Can you tell me if Google's Gemini AI is experiencing any service disruptions?\"\n- \"Show me the status of all AI platforms including OpenRouter and OpenAI\"\n- \"Are there any active incidents affecting GitHub Actions or Git operations?\"\n- \"Check the overall health of Vercel and Netlify for my deployment pipeline\"\n- \"Has Supabase had any recent database or authentication issues?\"\n- \"What's the status of all major platforms right now?\"\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Server disconnected\" error\nIf you see the error \"MCP Status Observer: Server disconnected\" in Claude Desktop:\n\n1. **Verify the server is running**:\n   - Open a terminal and manually run `node build/index.js` from the project directory\n   - If the server starts successfully, use Claude while keeping this terminal open\n\n2. **Check your configuration**:\n   - Ensure the absolute path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct for your system\n   - Double-check that you've used double backslashes (`\\\\`) for Windows paths\n   - Verify you're using the complete path from the root of your filesystem\n\n### Tools not appearing in Claude\nIf the Status Observer tools don't appear in Claude:\n- Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after configuration\n- Check the Claude Desktop logs for any MCP communication errors\n- Ensure the MCP server process is running (run it manually to confirm)\n- Verify that the MCP server is correctly registered in the Claude Desktop MCP registry\n\n### Checking if the server is running\nTo check if the server is running:\n\n- **Windows**: Open Task Manager, go to the \"Details\" tab, and look for \"node.exe\"\n- **macOS/Linux**: Open Terminal and run `ps aux | grep node`\n\nIf you don't see the server running, start it manually or use the auto-start method.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Adding New Status APIs\n\nContributors can easily add support for additional platforms by modifying the `initializePlatforms` method in `src/index.ts`. The process is straightforward:\n\n1. Identify a platform's status API endpoint\n2. Add a new entry using the `addPlatform` method with the following parameters:\n   - `id`: A unique identifier for the platform (lowercase, no spaces)\n   - `name`: The display name of the platform\n   - `url`: The status API endpoint URL\n   - `description`: A brief description of the platform\n\nExample:\n```typescript\nthis.addPlatform('newservice', 'New Service', 'https://status.newservice.com/api/v2/summary.json', 'Description of the service');\n```\n\n### Custom API Integration\n\nFor platforms with non-standard status pages (like OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic), you can create custom handlers:\n\n1. Add the platform to `initializePlatforms()`\n2. Create a TypeScript interface for the response format\n3. Add a specific handler method like `getOpenRouterStatus()`\n4. Update the main `getPlatformStatus()` method to route to your handler\n5. Add quick status support in `getQuickPlatformStatus()`\n\nExample structure for custom handlers:\n```typescript\nprivate async getCustomPlatformStatus(platform: PlatformStatus): Promise<string> {\n  // Custom parsing logic for your platform\n  // Return formatted status text\n}\n```\n\n### Platform Categories\n\nWhen adding new platforms, consider organizing them into logical categories:\n- **AI/ML**: OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini\n- **Cloud Infrastructure**: GCP, AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean\n- **Developer Tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Docker, npm\n- **Productivity**: Slack, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace\n- **Web Infrastructure**: Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-claude-hackernews/blob/main/LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Related Links\n\n- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\n- [MCP Series](https://github.com/mcp-series)\n\n## Changelog\n\n- **2025-09-12**: Added OpenRouter integration with RSS incident tracking and detailed impact analysis\n- **2025-04-26**: Added Docker status integration with comprehensive component monitoring\n- **2025-03-15**: Enhanced GCP regional status reporting with incident correlation\n- **2025-02-28**: Added Anthropic and Gemini AI platform monitoring\n- **2025-01-20**: Initial release with core platform support (GitHub, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.)\n\n---\n\n*Built for the developer community by [imprvhub](https://github.com/imprvhub)*",

Will address both when time allows \n(needed it for a real work problem, have to fix that first)\n\n### Tools\n\n#### search_logs\nSearch SolarWinds Observability logs with optional filtering\n- Takes search parameters including filter, time range, and pagination options\n- Returns formatted log entries with timestamps, hostnames, and messages\n- Supports advanced filtering by group, entity, and more\n- Default search range is the last 24 hours\n\n#### visualize_logs\nGenerate a histogram json response for of log events\n- Formatted for Claude and canvas representations\n- Configurable time intervals (minute, hour, day)\n- Supports UTC or local time zones\n- Customizable query filters and time ranges\n- Default visualization range is the last 24 hours\n\n### Resources\n\n#### SolarWinds Log Search\n- URI Template: `solarwinds://{query}/search`\n- Returns log entries matching the specified query\n- Example: `solarwinds://error/search`\n\n## Installation\n\nOptionally install from npm:\n```bash\nnpm install -g mcp-solarwinds\n```\n\nOr clone and build from source:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/@jakenuts/mcp-solarwinds.git\ncd mcp-solarwinds\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\nOr just use npx in your configurations\n\n### For Cline VSCode Extension\n\nAdd to `%APPDATA%/Code - Insiders/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"solarwinds\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-solarwinds\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SOLARWINDS_API_TOKEN\": \"your-api-token\"\n      },\n      \"autoApprove\": [\"search_logs\", \"visualize_logs\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### For Claude Desktop\n\nAdd to the appropriate config file:\n\nWindows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\nMacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"solarwinds\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-solarwinds\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SOLARWINDS_API_TOKEN\": \"your-api-token\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Special Windows Configuration\n\nIf you encounter the ENOENT spawn npx issue on Windows, use this alternative configuration that specifies the full paths:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"solarwinds\": {\n      \"command\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\[username]\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\nvm\\\\[node-version]\\\\node.exe\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"C:\\\\Users\\\\[username]\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\npm\\\\node_modules\\\\npm\\\\bin\\\\npx-cli.js\",\n        \"-y\",\n        \"mcp-solarwinds\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SOLARWINDS_API_TOKEN\": \"your-api-token\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe SolarWinds Observability MCP server requires an API token to authenticate with the SolarWinds Observability API.\n\n### Configuration Methods\n\nThere are multiple ways to provide the API token:\n\n1. **MCP Settings Configuration (Recommended)**: Configure the token in your MCP settings file\n2. **Environment Variable**: Set the `SOLARWINDS_API_TOKEN` environment variable\n3. **Local .env File (For Testing)**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with `SOLARWINDS_API_TOKEN=your-token`\n\nFor local testing, you can:\n1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your token\n2. Run the example script: `node examples/local-test.js`\n\n## Tool Usage Examples\n\n### search_logs\n\nBasic search:\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"error\"\n}\n```\n\nAdvanced search with time range and pagination:\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"error\",\n  \"entityId\": \"web-server\",\n  \"startTime\": \"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"endTime\": \"2025-03-05T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"pageSize\": 100,\n  \"direction\": \"backward\"\n}\n```\n\n### visualize_logs\n\nBasic histogram (ASCII chart):\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"error\",\n  \"interval\": \"hour\"\n}\n```\n\nAdvanced visualization (ASCII chart):\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"error\",\n  \"entityId\": \"web-server\",\n  \"startTime\": \"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"endTime\": \"2025-03-05T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"interval\": \"day\",\n  \"use_utc\": true\n}\n```\n\nClaude visualization (JSON format):\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"error\",\n  \"interval\": \"hour\",\n  \"format\": \"json\"\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON format returns data that Claude can visualize as a chart:\n```json\n{\n  \"timeRanges\": [\"12:02\", \"12:03\", \"12:04\", \"12:05\", \"12:06\", \"12:07\", \"12:08\", \"12:09\"],\n  \"counts\": [261, 47, 48, 48, 31, 262, 270, 33],\n  \"total\": 1000,\n  \"queryParams\": {\n    \"query\": \"error\",\n    \"startTime\": \"2025-03-05T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"endTime\": \"2025-03-05T23:59:59.000Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nBuild the server:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. The MCP Inspector provides helpful debugging tools:\n\n```bash\nnpm run debug:inspector\n```\n\nThis will provide a URL to access the inspector in your browser, where you can:\n- View all MCP messages\n- Inspect request/response payloads\n- Test tools interactively\n- Monitor server state\n\nFor local testing without the MCP framework:\n```bash\n# Create a .env file with your token\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env to add your token\n# Run the example script\nnode examples/local-test.js\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- Built with TypeScript and the MCP SDK\n- Uses axios for API communication\n- Supports ISO 8601 date formats for time ranges\n- Generates ASCII histograms for log visualization\n- Default search range: last 24 hours\n- Default page size: 50 logs\n- Supports multiple authentication methods\n",

It provides Claude with direct access to log files, making it easy to troubleshoot MCP integrations and understand how Claude interacts with your tools.\n\n- **Multi-platform Support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux with platform-specific log paths\n- **Smart Filtering**: Find specific log entries with case-insensitive text search\n- **Paginated Browsing**: Navigate large log collections efficiently\n- **Size Management**: Handles large log files with intelligent truncation\n- **Seamless Claude Integration**: Works directly with Claude Desktop\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install MCP Log Reader for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@klara-research/MCP-Analyzer):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @klara-research/MCP-Analyzer --client claude\n```\n\n### Installing Manually\n\nInstall directly from GitHub:\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/klara-research/MCP-Analyzer.git\ncd MCP-Analyzer\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm i\n```\n\nBuild and run:\n```bash\n# Compile TypeScript\nnpx tsc\n```\n\n## 🔌 Connecting to Claude\n\nAdd the server to your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"log-reader\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/absolute/path/MCP-Analyzer/build\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen restart Claude Desktop.\n\n## 📋 Available Parameters\n\nThe log reader supports these parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description | Default |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `lines` | Number of lines to read from each log file | 100 |\n| `filter` | Text to filter log entries by (case-insensitive) | \"\" |\n| `customPath` | Custom path to log directory | OS-specific |\n| `fileLimit` | Maximum number of files to read per page | 5 |\n| `page` | Page number for pagination | 1 |\n\n## 💡 Example Usage\n\nAsk Claude to use the log reader tool:\n\n```\nCan you check my MCP logs for any connection errors in the last day?\n```\n\nOr with specific parameters:\n\n```\nCan you look through MCP logs with filter=\"error\" and lines=50 to find initialization issues?\n```\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. The server automatically detects your OS and finds the appropriate log directory\n2. It locates all MCP log files and sorts them by modification time (newest first)\n3. The requested page of log files is retrieved based on pagination settings\n4. Files are processed with size limits to prevent overwhelming responses\n5. Filtered content is returned in a structured format with pagination details\n\n## 📄 License\n\nMIT License\n",

You can see the runtime information of a single machine in real-time, and the aggregated runtime info of a cluster with less than 500 nodes.\n- **Widespread open-source ecosystem**: Sentinel provides out-of-box integrations with commonly-used frameworks and libraries such as Spring Cloud, Dubbo and gRPC. You can easily use Sentinel by simply add the adapter dependency to your services.\n- **Polyglot support**: Sentinel has provided native support for Java, [Go](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang) and [C++](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-cpp).\n- **Various SPI extensions**: Sentinel provides easy-to-use SPI extension interfaces that allow you to quickly customize your logic, for example, custom rule management, adapting data sources, and so on.\n\nFeatures overview:\n\n![features-of-sentinel](./doc/image/sentinel-features-overview-en.png)\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [中文文档](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D) for document in Chinese.\n\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki) for full documentation, examples, blog posts, operational details and other information.\n\nSentinel provides integration modules for various open-source frameworks\n(e.g. Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo, gRPC, Spring WebFlux, Reactor) and service mesh.\nYou can refer to [the document](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Adapters-to-Popular-Framework) for more information.\n\nIf you are using Sentinel, please [**leave a comment here**](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues/18) to tell us your scenario to make Sentinel better.\nIt's also encouraged to add the link of your blog post, tutorial, demo or customized components to [**Awesome Sentinel**](./doc/awesome-sentinel.md).\n\n## Ecosystem Landscape\n\n![ecosystem-landscape](./doc/image/sentinel-opensource-eco-landscape-en.png)\n\n## Quick Start\n\nBelow is a simple demo that guides new users to use Sentinel in just 3 steps. It also shows how to monitor this demo using the dashboard.\n\n### 1. Add Dependency\n\n**Note:** Sentinel Core requires Java 7 or later.\n\nIf your're using Maven, just add the following dependency in `pom.xml`.\n\n```xml\n<!-- replace here with the latest version -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.alibaba.csp</groupId>\n    <artifactId>sentinel-core</artifactId>\n    <version>1.8.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf not, you can download JAR in [Maven Center Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.alibaba.csp/sentinel-core).\n\n### 2. Define Resource\n\nWrap your code snippet via Sentinel API: `SphU.entry(resourceName)`.\nIn below example, it is `System.out.println(\"hello world\");`:\n\n```java\ntry (Entry entry = SphU.entry(\"HelloWorld\")) {\n    // Your business logic here.\n    System.out.println(\"hello world\");\n} catch (BlockException e) {\n    // Handle rejected request.\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n// try-with-resources auto exit\n```\n\nSo far the code modification is done. We've also provided [annotation support module](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/blob/master/sentinel-extension/sentinel-annotation-aspectj/README.md) to define resource easier.\n\n### 3. Define Rules\n\nIf we want to limit the access times of the resource, we can **set rules to the resource**.\nThe following code defines a rule that limits access to the resource to 20 times per second at the maximum.\n\n```java\nList<FlowRule> rules = new ArrayList<>();\nFlowRule rule = new FlowRule();\nrule.setResource(\"HelloWorld\");\n// set limit qps to 20\nrule.setCount(20);\nrule.setGrade(RuleConstant.FLOW_GRADE_QPS);\nrules.add(rule);\nFlowRuleManager.loadRules(rules);\n```\n\nFor more information, please refer to [How To Use](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-to-Use).\n\n### 4. Check the Result\n\nAfter running the demo for a while, you can see the following records in `~/logs/csp/${appName}-metrics.log.{date}` (When using the default `DateFileLogHandler`).\n\n```\n|--timestamp-|------date time----|-resource-|p |block|s |e|rt  |occupied\n1529998904000|2018-06-26 15:41:44|HelloWorld|20|0    |20|0|0   |0\n1529998905000|2018-06-26 15:41:45|HelloWorld|20|5579 |20|0|728 |0\n1529998906000|2018-06-26 15:41:46|HelloWorld|20|15698|20|0|0   |0\n1529998907000|2018-06-26 15:41:47|HelloWorld|20|19262|20|0|0   |0\n1529998908000|2018-06-26 15:41:48|HelloWorld|20|19502|20|0|0   |0\n1529998909000|2018-06-26 15:41:49|HelloWorld|20|18386|20|0|0   |0\n\np stands for incoming request, block for blocked by rules, success for success handled by Sentinel, e for exception count, rt for average response time (ms), occupied stands for occupiedPassQps since 1.5.0 which enable us booking more than 1 shot when entering.\n```\n\nThis shows that the demo can print \"hello world\" 20 times per second.\n\nMore examples and information can be found in the [How To Use](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-to-Use) section.\n\nThe working principles of Sentinel can be found in [How it works](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/How-it-works) section.\n\nSamples can be found in the [sentinel-demo](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/tree/master/sentinel-demo) module.\n\n### 5. Start Dashboard\n\n> Note: Java 8 is required for building or running the dashboard.\n\nSentinel also provides a simple dashboard application, on which you can monitor the clients and configure the rules in real time.\n\n![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9434884/55449295-84866d80-55fd-11e9-94e5-d3441f4a2b63.png)\n\nFor details please refer to [Dashboard](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Dashboard).\n\n## Trouble Shooting and Logs\n\nSentinel will generate logs for troubleshooting and real-time monitoring.\nAll the information can be found in [logs](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Logs).\n\n## Bugs and Feedback\n\nFor bug report, questions and discussions please submit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel/issues).\n\nContact us via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel) or [Email](mailto:sentinel@linux.alibaba.com).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcomed!

**阿里云访问密钥 (AccessKey)**：\n    *   服务运行需要有效的阿里云 AccessKey ID 和 AccessKey Secret。\n    *   获取和管理 AccessKey，请参考 [阿里云 AccessKey 管理官方文档](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/53045.html)。\n  \n2. 当你初始化时候不传入 AccessKey 和 AccessKey Secret 时，会使用[默认凭据链进行登录](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/sdk/developer-reference/v2-manage-python-access-credentials#62bf90d04dztq)\n   1. 如果环境变量 中的ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID 和 ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET均存在且非空，则使用它们作为默认凭据。\n   2. 如果同时设置了ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID、ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET和ALIBABA_CLOUD_SECURITY_TOKEN，则使用STS Token作为默认凭据。\n   \n3.  **RAM 授权 (重要)**：\n    *   与 AccessKey 关联的 RAM 用户或角色**必须**被授予访问相关云服务所需的权限。\n    *   **强烈建议遵循\"最小权限原则\"**：仅授予运行您计划使用的 MCP 工具所必需的最小权限集，以降低安全风险。\n    *   根据您需要使用的工具，参考以下文档进行权限配置：\n        *   **日志服务 (SLS)**：如果您需要使用 `sls_*` 相关工具，请参考 [日志服务权限说明](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/sls/overview-8)，并授予必要的读取、查询等权限。\n        *   **应用实时监控服务 (ARMS)**：如果您需要使用 `arms_*` 相关工具，请参考 [ARMS 权限说明](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/arms/security-and-compliance/overview-8?scm=20140722.H_74783._.OR_help-T_cn~zh-V_1)，并授予必要的查询权限。\n    *   请根据您的实际应用场景，精细化配置所需权限。\n\n### 安全与部署建议\n\n请务必关注以下安全事项和部署最佳实践：\n\n1.  **密钥安全**：\n    *   本 MCP Server 在运行时会使用您提供的 AccessKey 调用阿里云 OpenAPI，但**不会以任何形式存储您的 AccessKey**，也不会将其用于设计功能之外的任何其他用途。\n\n2.  **访问控制 (关键)**：\n    *   当您选择通过 **SSE (Server-Sent Events) 协议** 访问 MCP Server 时，**您必须自行负责该服务接入点的访问控制和安全防护**。\n    *   **强烈建议**将 MCP Server 部署在**内部网络或受信环境**中，例如您的私有 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 内，避免直接暴露于公共互联网。\n    *   推荐的部署方式是使用**阿里云函数计算 (FC)**，并配置其网络设置为**仅 VPC 内访问**，以实现网络层面的隔离和安全。\n    *   **注意**：**切勿**在没有任何身份验证或访问控制机制的情况下，将配置了您 AccessKey 的 MCP Server SSE 端点暴露在公共互联网上，这会带来极高的安全风险。\n\n### 使用说明\n\n\n在使用 MCP Server 之前，需要先获取阿里云的 AccessKeyId 和 AccessKeySecret，请参考 [阿里云 AccessKey 管理](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/53045.html)\n\n\n#### 使用 pip 安装\n> ⚠️ 需要 Python 3.10 及以上版本。\n\n直接使用 pip 安装即可，安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\npip install mcp-server-aliyun-observability\n```\n1. 安装之后，直接运行即可，运行命令如下：\n\n```bash\npython -m mcp_server_aliyun_observability --transport sse --access-key-id <your_access_key_id> --access-key-secret <your_access_key_secret>\n```\n可通过命令行传递指定参数:\n- `--transport` 指定传输方式，可选值为 `sse` 或 `stdio`，默认值为 `stdio`\n- `--access-key-id` 指定阿里云 AccessKeyId，不指定时会使用环境变量中的ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n- `--access-key-secret` 指定阿里云 AccessKeySecret，不指定时会使用环境变量中的ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET\n- `--log-level` 指定日志级别，可选值为 `DEBUG`、`INFO`、`WARNING`、`ERROR`，默认值为 `INFO`\n- `--transport-port` 指定传输端口，默认值为 `8000`,仅当 `--transport` 为 `sse` 时有效\n\n2. 使用uv 命令启动\n   可以指定下版本号，会自动拉取对应依赖，默认是 studio 方式启动\n```bash\nuvx --from 'mcp-server-aliyun-observability==0.2.1' mcp-server-aliyun-observability \n```\n\n3. 使用 uvx 命令启动\n\n```bash\nuvx run mcp-server-aliyun-observability\n```\n\n### 从源码安装\n\n```bash\n\n# clone 源码\ngit clone git@github.com:aliyun/alibabacloud-observability-mcp-server.git\n# 进入源码目录\ncd alibabacloud-observability-mcp-server\n# 安装\npip install -e .\n# 运行\npython -m mcp_server_aliyun_observability --transport sse --access-key-id <your_access_key_id> --access-key-secret <your_access_key_secret>\n```\n\n\n### AI 工具集成\n\n> 以 SSE 启动方式为例,transport 端口为 8888,实际使用时需要根据实际情况修改\n\n#### Cursor，Cline 等集成\n1. 使用 SSE 启动方式\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"alibaba_cloud_observability\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:7897/sse\"\n        }\n  }\n}\n```\n2. 使用 stdio 启动方式\n   直接从源码目录启动,注意\n    1. 需要指定 `--directory` 参数,指定源码目录，最好是绝对路径\n    2. uv命令 最好也使用绝对路径，如果使用了虚拟环境，则需要使用虚拟环境的绝对路径\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"alibaba_cloud_observability\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/path/to/your/alibabacloud-observability-mcp-server\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"mcp-server-aliyun-observability\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID\": \"<your_access_key_id>\",\n        \"ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET\": \"<your_access_key_secret>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n1. 使用 stdio 启动方式-从 module 启动\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"alibaba_cloud_observability\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"mcp-server-aliyun-observability\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n

Create or edit the Claude Desktop configuration file located at:\n   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n2. Add the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-ntopng\": {\n      \"command\": \"/path/to/your/uv-binary\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"--with\", \"mcp-ntopng\", \"--python\", \"3.13\", \"mcp-ntopng\"]\n      \"env\": {\n        \"NTOPNG_HOST\": \"<ntopng-host>\",\n        \"NTOPNG_DBPORT\": \"<ntopng-dbport>\",\n        \"NTOPNG_DBUSER\": \"<ntopng-dbuser>\",\n        \"NTOPNG_DBPASSWORD\": \"<ntopng-dbpassword>\",\n        \"NTOPNG_SECURE\": \"true\",\n        \"NTOPNG_VERIFY\": \"true\",\n        \"NTOPNG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\": \"30\",\n        \"NTOPNG_SEND_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT\": \"300\",\n        \"NTOPNG_API_KEY\": \"NTOPNG_TOKEN\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n3. Replace `/path/to/your/uv-binary` with the absolute path to the `uv` executable. Find the path with `which uv`. This ensures that the correct version of `uv` is used when starting the server.\n\n4. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.\n\n\n## Development \n\n1. Set the environmental variables either in the `claude_desktop_config.json` file or in a `.env` file in the root of the repository.\n\n```\nNTOPNG_HOST=localhost\nNTOPNG_PORT=9000\nNTOPNG_USER=default\nNTOPNG_PASSWORD=\n```\n\n3. Run `uv sync` to install the dependencies. To install `uv` follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Then do `source .venv/bin/activate`.\n\n4. Install the `mcp-ntopng` package with `uv pip install -e .` from the project main directory. \n\n4. For easy testing, you can run `mcp dev mcp_ntopng/mcp_server.py` to start the MCP server. **CHANGE WITH A PROPER CHAT CLIENT**\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment variables are used to configure the database connection:\n\n* `NTOPNG_HOST`: The hostname of the `ntopng` server\n* `NTOPNG_DBUSER`: The username for Clickhouse DB authentication\n* `NTOPNG_DBPASSWORD`: The password for Clickhouse DB authentication\n* `NTOPNG_API_KEY`: The `ntopng` authentication token.\n\n#### Optional\n* `NTOPNG_DBPORT`: The port number of the Clickhouse DB in the  `ntopng` server\n  - Default: `9000` if HTTPS is enabled, `8123` if disabled\n  - Usually doesn't need to be set unless using a non-standard port\n* `NTOPNG_SECURE`: Enable/disable a TLS connection\n  - Default: `false`\n  - Set to `true` for a secure TLS connections\n* `NTOPNG_VERIFY`: Enable/disable SSL certificate verification\n  - Default: `true`\n  - Set to `false to disable certificate verification (not recommended for production)\n* `NTOPNG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds\n  - Default: `30\n  - Increase this value if you experience connection timeouts\n* `NTOPNG_SEND_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT`: Send/receive timeout in seconds\n  - Default: `300`\n  - Increase this value for long-running queries\n\n\n> Check [TLS Setup](https://www.ntop.org/guides/ntopng/flow_dump/clickhouse/clickhouse.html#tls-connection) in the `ntopng` documentation for details about setting up a TLS connection to Clickhouse.\n\n### Development\nInstall the package on the local machine:\n```\n$ uv sync\n$ uv pip install -e .\n```\nRun the MCP Inspector\n```\n$ cd mcp_ntopng\n$ source .env\n$ CLIENT_PORT=8077 SERVER_PORT=8078  mcp dev run_mcp_ntopng.py --with clickhouse-driver --with python-dotenv --with uvicorn --with pip-system-certs\n```\nUse the local library in Claude Desktop.\n\nFind:  /Users/marco/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json \n\nEdit the claude_desktop_config.json changing the local paths:\n```\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"mcp-ntopng\": {\n        \"command\": \"/Users/marco/Development/claude/mcp-server-ntopng/.venv/bin/python\",\n        \"args\": [\n           \"/Users/marco/Development/claude/mcp-server-ntopng/run_mcp_ntopng.py\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"NTOPNG_HOST\": \"marcoeg-nod004.ntoplink.com\",\n          \"NTOPNG_DBPORT\": \"9000\",\n          \"NTOPNG_DBUSER\": \"default\",\n          \"NTOPNG_DBPASSWORD\": \"\",\n          \"NTOPNG_SECURE\": \"false\",\n          \"NTOPNG_VERIFY\": \"false\",\n          \"NTOPNG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT\": \"30\",\n          \"NTOPNG_SEND_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT\": \"300\",\n          \"SELECT_QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECS\": \"30\",\n          \"NTOPNG_API_KEY\": \"NTOPNG_TOKEN\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n",

      "readme_content": "# ConsoleSpy: An MCP Server for Cursor\n\nA tool that captures browser console logs and makes them available in Cursor IDE through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n## Overview\n\nThis tool consists of:\n\n1. A server that captures console logs from your browser\n2. An MCP server that makes these logs available to Cursor\n3. A browser extension that sends console logs to the server\n\n## Installation\n\n### Server Setup\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/mgsrevolver/consolespy.git\n   cd consolespy\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Run the setup script to configure the MCP connection for Cursor:\n   ```bash\n   ./setup.sh\n   ```\n\n### Browser Extension Installation\n\n1. Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/consolespy/dakkehkpcaahfjembkhchoplffakkcie?authuser=0&hl=en)\n\n   OR\n\n   Load the extension in developer mode:\n\n   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`\n   - Enable \"Developer mode\" (toggle in the top-right corner)\n   - Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the `extension` folder from this repository\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the Servers\n\n1. Start the console log server:\n\n   ```bash\n   node mcp-server.js\n   ```\n\n2. In a separate terminal, start the MCP server:\n   ```bash\n   npx supergateway --port 8766 --stdio \"node console-spy-mcp.js\"\n   ```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the start script to launch both servers at once:\n\n```bash\n./start-servers.sh\n```\n\n### Configuring Cursor\n\nAfter running the setup script, you still need to manually add the MCP server in Cursor:\n\n1. Go to Settings > Features > MCP in Cursor\n2. Add a new MCP server with:\n   - Name: ConsoleSpy\n   - Type: sse\n   - URL: http://localhost:8766/sse\n\n### Using the Extension\n\n1. Click the extension icon in your browser to toggle it on/off\n2. When enabled, all console logs from the current tab will be sent to the server\n3. In Cursor, you can now access these logs through the MCP interface\n\n## Customizing\n\n### Changing the Console Log Server Port\n\nIf you need to use a different port for the console log server (default is 3333), you'll need to update the port in multiple places:\n\n1. In `mcp-server.js`, change the port variable:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const port = 3333; // Change to your desired port\n   ```\n\n2. In `console-spy-mcp.js`, update the URL to match your new port:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const CONSOLE_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3333/mcp'; // Change 3333 to your port\n   ```\n\n3. In the browser extension's `content.js`, update the server URL:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const serverUrl = 'http://localhost:3333/console-logs'; // Change 3333 to your port\n   ```\n\n4. If using `start-servers.sh`, update the port reference there as well.\n\n**Important:** You must use the same port number in all locations. We recommend doing a global search for \"3333\" in the project files and replacing all instances with your desired port number to ensure consistency.\n\nIf you're testing locally with another application already using port 3333, changing this port is essential for the tool to work correctly.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Make sure both servers are running\n- Verify the browser extension is enabled for the tab you're debugging\n- Check that you've added the MCP server in Cursor's settings\n- If logs aren't appearing, try refreshing the page or restarting the servers\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](LICENSE)\n\n<a href=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/uVY0ERoHE0\">\n  <img width=\"380\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/uVY0ERoHE0/badge\" />\n</a>\n",

For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"memory\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/path/to/allowed/files\"]\n    },\n    \"git\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-git\", \"--repository\", \"path/to/git/repo\"]\n    },\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"postgres\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres\", \"postgresql://localhost/mydb\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 🛠️ Creating Your Own Server\n\nInterested in creating your own MCP server?

Edit `src/index.ts`\n2. Add new tools in the `registerTools()` method\n3. Follow the existing pattern for consistent error handling\n4. Build with `npm run build`\n\n### Adding a Tool Example\n\n```typescript\n// In the registerTools() method:\nthis.server.tool(\n  \"my_ps_tool\",\n  {\n    param1: z.string().describe(\"Description of parameter 1\"),\n    param2: z.number().optional().describe(\"Optional numeric parameter\"),\n  },\n  async ({ param1, param2 }) => {\n    try {\n      // Your PowerShell command\n      const command = `Your-PowerShell-Command -Param1 \"${param1}\" ${param2 ? `-Param2 ${param2}` : ''}`;\n\n      const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync(`powershell -Command \"${command.replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"')}\"`);\n\n      if (stderr) {\n        return {\n          isError: true,\n          content: [\n            {\n              type: \"text\" as const,\n              text: `Error in my_ps_tool: ${stderr}`,\n            },\n          ],\n        };\n      }\n\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\" as const,\n            text: stdout,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    } catch (error) {\n      return {\n        isError: true,\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\" as const,\n            text: `Error in my_ps_tool: ${(error as Error).message}`,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- This server executes PowerShell commands directly on your system\n- Commands are executed with the same privileges as the process running the MCP server\n- Use caution when exposing destructive operations\n- Consider implementing additional validation for sensitive commands\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **PowerShell execution policy restrictions**\n   - You may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution\n   - Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` to allow local scripts\n\n2. **Path not found errors**\n   - Ensure file paths are absolute or properly relative to the working directory\n   - Use appropriate path separators for your OS\n\n3. **Command not found errors**\n   - Some commands may require specific modules to be installed\n   - Use `Install-Module ModuleName` to install required modules\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Token authentication takes priority if multiple methods are configured.\n\n#### Connection Settings\n\n| Variable                 | Description                                              | Required  | Default                 |\n| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |\n| `SONARQUBE_URL`          | URL of your SonarQube instance                           | ❌ No     | `https://sonarcloud.io` |\n| `SONARQUBE_ORGANIZATION` | Organization key (required for SonarCloud)               | ❌ No\\*\\* | -                       |\n| `LOG_FILE`               | Path to write log files (e.g., `/tmp/sonarqube-mcp.log`) | ❌ No     | -                       |\n| `LOG_LEVEL`              | Minimum log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)             | ❌ No     | `DEBUG`                 |\n\n\\*\\*Required when using SonarCloud\n\n#### HTTP Transport Settings (Advanced)\n\nBy default, the server uses stdio transport for communication with Claude Desktop. For programmatic access or running as a web service, HTTP transport is available:\n\n| Variable                                   | Description                                  | Required | Default     |\n| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |\n| `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`                       | Transport type (`stdio` or `http`)           | ❌ No    | `stdio`     |\n| `MCP_HTTP_PORT`                            | Port for HTTP server                         | ❌ No    | `3000`      |\n| `MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT`                 | Session timeout in milliseconds              | ❌ No    | `1800000`   |\n| `MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`                   | Comma-separated list of allowed hosts        | ❌ No    | `localhost` |\n| `MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`                 | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins | ❌ No    | `*`         |\n| `MCP_HTTP_ENABLE_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION` | Enable DNS rebinding protection              | ❌ No    | `false`     |\n\n### Authentication Methods\n\nThe server supports three authentication methods, with important differences between SonarQube versions:\n\n#### 1. Token Authentication (Recommended)\n\n##### SonarQube 10.0+ (Bearer Token)\n\n- Starting with SonarQube 10.0, Bearer token authentication is the recommended approach\n- Most secure and flexible option\n- Tokens can have limited permissions\n- Configuration:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"env\": {\n      \"SONARQUBE_TOKEN\": \"your-token-here\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n##### SonarQube < 10.0 (Token as Username)\n\n- For versions before 10.0, tokens must be sent as the username in Basic authentication\n- No password is required when using a token as username\n- The server automatically handles this based on your SonarQube version\n- Configuration remains the same - just use `SONARQUBE_USERNAME` with the token value:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"env\": {\n      \"SONARQUBE_USERNAME\": \"your-token-here\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### 2. Basic Authentication\n\n- Traditional username and password authentication\n- Suitable for self-hosted SonarQube instances\n- May not work with SonarCloud if 2FA is enabled\n- Configuration:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"env\": {\n      \"SONARQUBE_USERNAME\": \"your-username\",\n      \"SONARQUBE_PASSWORD\": \"your-password\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### 3. System Passcode\n\n- Special authentication for SonarQube system administration\n- Typically used for automated deployment scenarios\n- Configuration:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"env\": {\n      \"SONARQUBE_PASSCODE\": \"your-system-passcode\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Note:** Token authentication takes priority if multiple authentication methods are configured. The server will automatically use the appropriate authentication strategy based on your SonarQube version.\n\n### SonarCloud vs SonarQube\n\n**For SonarCloud:**\n\n- Set `SONARQUBE_URL` to `https://sonarcloud.io`\n- `SONARQUBE_ORGANIZATION` is required\n- Token authentication is recommended\n\n**For SonarQube Server:**\n\n- Set `SONARQUBE_URL` to your instance URL\n- `SONARQUBE_ORGANIZATION` is typically not needed\n- All authentication methods are supported\n\n### HTTP Transport Mode\n\nThe server supports HTTP transport for programmatic access and web service deployments. This enables integration with custom clients and web applications.\n\n#### Running as an HTTP Server\n\nStart the server with HTTP transport:\n\n```bash\n# Using environment variables\nMCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000 npx sonarqube-mcp-server\n\n# With Docker\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http \\\n  -e MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000 \\\n  -e SONARQUBE_URL=https://sonarcloud.io \\\n  -e SONARQUBE_TOKEN=your-token \\\n  sapientpants/sonarqube-mcp-server:latest\n```\n\n#### HTTP API Endpoints\n\nWhen running in HTTP mode, the server exposes the following endpoints:\n\n- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint\n- `POST /session` - Create a new session\n- `DELETE /session/:sessionId` - Close a session\n- `POST /mcp` - Execute MCP requests\n- `GET /events/:sessionId` - Server-sent events for notifications\n\n#### Example HTTP Client\n\nSee [examples/http-client.ts](examples/http-client.ts) for a complete TypeScript client example.\n\nBasic usage with curl:\n\n```bash\n# Health check\ncurl http://localhost:3000/health\n\n# Create session\nSESSION_ID=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/session | jq -r .sessionId)\n\n# Execute MCP request\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\n    \\\"sessionId\\\": \\\"$SESSION_ID\\\",\n    \\\"method\\\": \\\"tools/list\\\",\n    \\\"params\\\": {}\n  }\"\n\n# Close session\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/session/$SESSION_ID\n```\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nWhen running in HTTP mode:\n\n1. **Enable DNS rebinding protection** for public deployments:\n\n   ```bash\n   MCP_HTTP_ENABLE_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION=true\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure CORS** for browser-based clients:\n\n   ```bash\n   MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourapp.com,https://anotherapp.com\n   ```\n\n3. **Set session timeouts** appropriately:\n\n   ```bash\n   MCP_HTTP_SESSION_TIMEOUT=900000  # 15 minutes\n   ```\n\n4. **Use HTTPS** in production (configure through a reverse proxy like nginx)\n\n### Elicitation Configuration (Experimental)\n\nThe server supports interactive user input through MCP's elicitation capability.

      "readme_content": "# MCP Logging NL Query Server\n\nThis project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows developers and AI Agents to query Google Cloud Logging using natural language. The server uses Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 to translate natural language queries into Google Cloud Logging Query Language (LQL), then queries Cloud Logging and returns the results.\n\n## Features\n- **Natural language to LQL translation** using Vertex AI Gemini 2.5\n- **Flexible log querying**: filter on monitored resource, log name, severity, time, and more\n- **REST API** for easy integration\n- **Ready for deployment** on Google Cloud Run or GKE\n\n## API Usage\n\n### Endpoints\n\n#### 1. Natural Language Query\n`POST /logs/nl_query`\n\nRequest:\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"Show me all error logs from yesterday for my Cloud Run service 'my-service'\",\n  \"max_results\": 20\n}\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"lql\": \"resource.type = \\\"cloud_run_revision\\\" AND resource.labels.service_name = \\\"my-service\\\" AND severity = ERROR AND timestamp >= \\\"2025-04-17T00:00:00Z\\\" AND timestamp < \\\"2025-04-18T00:00:00Z\\\"\",\n  \"entries\": [ ... log entries ... ]\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. LQL Filter Query\n`POST /logs/query`\n\nRequest:\n```json\n{\n  \"filter\": \"resource.type=\\\"cloud_run_revision\\\" AND severity=ERROR\",\n  \"max_results\": 20\n}\n```\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"lql\": \"resource.type=\\\"cloud_run_revision\\\" AND severity=ERROR\",\n  \"entries\": [ ... log entries ... ]\n}\n```\n\n### OpenAPI & Tooling\n- OpenAPI/Swagger docs available at `/docs` and `/openapi.json` when running.\n- Both endpoints are also discoverable as MCP tools for agent frameworks (Smithery, Claude Desktop, etc).\n\n### Example curl commands\n```sh\ncurl -X POST $MCP_BASE_URL/logs/nl_query -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"query\": \"Show error logs for my Cloud Run service\", \"max_results\": 2}'\n\ncurl -X POST $MCP_BASE_URL/logs/query -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"filter\": \"resource.type=\\\"cloud_run_revision\\\" AND severity=ERROR\", \"max_results\": 2}'\n```\n\n### Tests\n- Example test script: `test_main.py` (see repo)\n\n### .gitignore\n- Standard Python ignores included (see repo)\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Running on Google Cloud Run\nYou can deploy this server to [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) for a fully managed, scalable solution.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Build the Docker image:**\n   ```sh\n   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/mcp-logging-server\n   ```\n2. **Deploy to Cloud Run:**\n   ```sh\n   gcloud run deploy mcp-logging-server \\\n     --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/mcp-logging-server \\\n     --platform managed \\\n     --region YOUR_REGION \\\n     --allow-unauthenticated \\\n     --port 8080\n   ```\n   Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_REGION` with your actual GCP project ID and region (e.g., `us-central1`).\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - In the Cloud Run deployment UI or with the `--set-env-vars` flag, provide:\n     - `VERTEX_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id`\n     - `VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1` (or your region)\n   - **Credentials:**\n     - Prefer using the Cloud Run service account with the right IAM roles (Logging Viewer, Vertex AI User).\n     - You usually do NOT need to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` on Cloud Run unless using a non-default service account key.\n\n4. **IAM Permissions:**\n   - Ensure the Cloud Run service account has:\n     - `roles/logging.viewer`\n     - `roles/aiplatform.user`\n\n5. **Accessing the Service:**\n   - After deployment, Cloud Run will provide a service URL (e.g., `https://mcp-logging-server-xxxxxx.a.run.app`).\n   - Use this as your `$MCP_BASE_URL` in API requests.\n\n### Google Cloud Authentication Setup\nThis project requires Google Cloud Application Default Credentials (ADC) to access Logging and Vertex AI APIs.\n\n**Steps to Set Up Credentials:**\n1. **Create a Service Account:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).\n   - Select your project.\n   - Create or select a service account with permissions: _Logging Viewer_ and _Vertex AI User_.\n2. **Create and Download a Key:**\n   - In the Service Account, click \"Manage keys\" → \"Add key\" → \"Create new key\" (choose JSON).\n   - Download the JSON key file to your computer.\n3. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n   - In your terminal, set the environment variable to the path of your downloaded key:\n     ```sh\n     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/service-account-key.json\"\n     ```\n   -

      "readme_content": "# Steampipe Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server\n\nUnlock the power of AI-driven infrastructure analysis with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io)! This Model Context Protocol server seamlessly connects AI assistants like Claude to your cloud infrastructure data, enabling natural language exploration and analysis of your entire cloud estate.\n\nSteampipe MCP bridges AI assistants and your infrastructure data, allowing natural language:\n- Queries across AWS, Azure, GCP and 100+ cloud services\n- Security and compliance analysis\n- Cost and resource optimization\n- Query development assistance\n\nWorks with both local [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads) installations and [Turbot Pipes](https://turbot.com/pipes) workspaces, providing safe, read-only access to all your cloud and SaaS data.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or higher (includes `npx`)\n- For local use: [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/downloads) installed and running (`steampipe service start`)\n- For Turbot Pipes: A [Turbot Pipes](https://turbot.com/pipes) workspace and connection string\n\n### Configuration\n\nAdd Steampipe MCP to your AI assistant's configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"steampipe\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@turbot/steampipe-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, this connects to your local Steampipe installation at `postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe`. Make sure to run `steampipe service start` first.\n\nTo connect to a [Turbot Pipes](https://turbot.com/pipes) workspace instead, add your connection string to the args:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"steampipe\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@turbot/steampipe-mcp\",\n        \"postgresql://my_name:my_pw@workspace-name.usea1.db.pipes.turbot.com:9193/abc123\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### AI Assistant Setup\n\n| Assistant | Config File Location | Setup Guide |\n|-----------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` | [Claude Desktop MCP Guide →](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) |\n| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | [Cursor MCP Guide →](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) |\n\nSave the configuration file and restart your AI assistant for the changes to take effect.\n\n## Prompting Guide\n\nFirst, run the `best_practices` prompt included in the MCP server to teach your LLM how best to work with Steampipe. Then, ask anything!\n\nExplore your cloud infrastructure:\n```\nWhat AWS accounts can you see?\n```\n\nSimple, specific questions work well:\n```\nShow me all S3 buckets that were created in the last week\n```\n\nGenerate infrastructure reports:\n```\nList my EC2 instances with their attached EBS volumes\n```\n\nDive into security analysis:\n```\nFind any IAM users with access keys that haven't been rotated in the last 90 days\n```\n\nGet compliance insights:\n```\nShow me all EC2 instances that don't comply with our tagging standards\n```\n\nExplore potential risks:\n```\nAnalyze my S3 buckets for security risks including public access, logging, and encryption\n```\n\nRemember to:\n- Be specific about which cloud resources you want to analyze (EC2, S3, IAM, etc.)\n- Mention regions or accounts if you're interested in specific ones\n- Start with simple queries before adding complex conditions\n- Use natural language - the LLM will handle the SQL translation\n- Be bold and exploratory - the LLM can help you discover insights across your entire infrastructure!\n\n## Capabilities\n\n### Tools\n\n- **steampipe_query**\n  - Query cloud and security logs with SQL.\n  - For best performance: use CTEs instead of joins, limit columns requested.\n  - All queries are read-only and use PostgreSQL syntax.\n  - Input: `sql` (string): The SQL query to execute using PostgreSQL syntax\n\n- **steampipe_table_list**\n  - List all available Steampipe tables.\n  - Optional input: `schema` (string): Filter tables by specific schema\n  - Optional input: `filter` (string): Filter tables by ILIKE pattern (e.g. '%ec2%')\n\n- **steampipe_table_show**\n  - Get detailed information about a specific table, including column definitions, data types, and descriptions.\n  - Input: `name` (string): The name of the table to show details for (can be schema qualified e.g. 'aws_account' or 'aws.aws_account')\n  - Optional input: `schema` (string): The schema containing the table\n\n- **steampipe_plugin_list**\n  - List all Steampipe plugins installed on the system. Plugins provide access to different data sources like AWS, GCP, or Azure.\n  - No input parameters required\n\n- **steampipe_plugin_show**\n  - Get details for a specific Steampipe plugin installation, including version, memory limits, and configuration.\n  - Input: `name` (string): Name of the plugin to show details for\n\n### Prompts\n\n- **best_practices**\n  - Best practices for working with Steampipe data\n  - Provides detailed guidance on:\n    - Response style and formatting conventions\n    - Using CTEs (WITH clauses) vs joins\n    - SQL syntax and style conventions\n    - Column selection and optimization\n    - Schema exploration and understanding\n    - Query structure and organization\n    - Performance considerations and caching\n    - Error handling and troubleshooting\n\n### Resources\n\n- **status**\n  - Represents the current state of the Steampipe connection\n  - Properties include:\n    - connection_string: The current database connection string\n    - status: The connection state (connected/disconnected)\n\nThis resource enables AI tools to check and verify the connection status to your Steampipe instance.\n\n## Development\n\n### Clone and Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mcp.git\ncd steampipe-mcp\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. Build the project:\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test your local development build with AI tools that support MCP, update your MCP configuration to use the local `dist/index.js` instead of the npm package. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"steampipe\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/absolute/path/to/steampipe-mcp/dist/index.js\",\n        \"postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr, use the MCP Inspector to validate the server implementation:\n```sh\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/index.js\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment variables can be used to configure the MCP server:\n\n- `STEAMPIPE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`: Control server logging verbosity (default: `info`)\n- `STEAMPIPE_MCP_WORKSPACE_DATABASE`: Override the default Steampipe connection string (default: `postgresql://steampipe@localhost:9193/steampipe`)\n\n## Open Source & Contributing\n\nThis repository is published under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

      "readme_content": "# FastMCP\n\nFastMCPは、クライアントセッション管理が可能な[MCP](https://glama.ai/mcp)サーバーを構築するためのTypeScriptフレームワークです。\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Python実装版は[FastMCP Python](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)をご覧ください。\n\n## 主な機能\n\nFastMCPは以下の機能を提供します：\n\n- シンプルなツール、リソース、プロンプト定義\n- [認証機能](#認証)\n- [セッション管理](#セッション)\n- [画像コンテンツ対応](#画像の返却)\n- [ロギング](#ロギング)\n- [エラーハンドリング](#エラー)\n- [SSE(Server-Sent Events)](#sse)\n- CORS（デフォルトで有効）\n- [進捗通知](#進捗通知)\n- [型付きサーバーイベント](#型付きサーバーイベント)\n- [プロンプト引数の自動補完](#プロンプト引数の自動補完)\n- [サンプリングリクエスト](#サンプリングリクエスト)\n- 自動SSEピング\n- ルート管理\n- [テスト](#mcp-cliでテスト)や[デバッグ](#mcp-inspectorで検査)のためのCLI\n\n## インストール方法\n\n```bash\nnpm install fastmcp\n```\n\n## クイックスタート\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> FastMCPの実際の使用例は多数あります。[事例紹介](#事例紹介)をご覧ください。\n\n```ts\nimport { FastMCP } from \"fastmcp\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\"; // または他の検証ライブラリ（Standard Schemaをサポートしているもの）\n\nconst server = new FastMCP({\n  name: \"マイサーバー\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n});\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"add\",\n  description: \"2つの数値を足し算します\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    a: z.number(),\n    b: z.number(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return String(args.a + args.b);\n  },\n});\n\nserver.start({\n  transportType: \"stdio\",\n});\n```\n\nこれだけで動作するMCPサーバーができました！\n\nターミナルで以下のようにテストできます：\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp.git\ncd fastmcp\n\npnpm install\npnpm build\n\n# CLIを使った足し算サーバーの例をテスト：\nnpx fastmcp dev src/examples/addition.ts\n# MCP Inspectorを使った足し算サーバーの例を検査：\nnpx fastmcp inspect src/examples/addition.ts\n```\n\n### SSE\n\n[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)（SSE）は、サーバーがHTTPS接続を介してクライアントにリアルタイム更新を送信するメカニズムです。MCPにおいて、SSEは主にリモートMCP通信を可能にするために使用され、リモートマシンでホストされたMCPにアクセスしてネットワーク経由で更新を中継できるようにします。\n\nSSEサポート付きでサーバーを実行することもできます：\n\n```ts\nserver.start({\n  transportType: \"sse\",\n  sse: {\n    endpoint: \"/sse\",\n    port: 8080,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nこれにより、サーバーが起動し、`http://localhost:8080/sse`でSSE接続をリッスンします。\n\nその後、`SSEClientTransport`を使用してサーバーに接続できます：\n\n```ts\nimport { SSEClientTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js\";\n\nconst client = new Client(\n  {\n    name: \"example-client\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nconst transport = new SSEClientTransport(new URL(`http://localhost:8080/sse`));\n\nawait client.connect(transport);\n```\n\n## 基本概念\n\n### ツール\n\nMCPの[ツール](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)では、サーバーが実行可能な関数を公開し、クライアントやLLMがアクションを実行するために呼び出すことができます。\n\nFastMCPはツールパラメーターの定義に[Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev)仕様を使用しています。これにより、Zod、ArkType、Valibotなど、仕様を実装している好みのスキーマ検証ライブラリを使用できます。\n\n**Zodの例：**\n\n```typescript\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"fetch-zod\",\n  description: \"URLのコンテンツを取得します（Zodを使用）\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return await fetchWebpageContent(args.url);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**ArkTypeの例：**\n\n```typescript\nimport { type } from \"arktype\";\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"fetch-arktype\",\n  description: \"URLのコンテンツを取得します（ArkTypeを使用）\",\n  parameters: type({\n    url: \"string\",\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return await fetchWebpageContent(args.url);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Valibotの例：**\n\nValibotにはピア依存関係@valibot/to-json-schemaが必要です。\n\n```typescript\nimport * as v from \"valibot\";\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"fetch-valibot\",\n  description: \"URLのコンテンツを取得します（Valibotを使用）\",\n  parameters: v.object({\n    url: v.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return await fetchWebpageContent(args.url);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### 文字列を返す\n\n`execute`は文字列を返すことができます：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return \"こんにちは、世界！\";\n  },\n});\n```\n\nこれは以下と同等です：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: \"text\",\n          text: \"こんにちは、世界！\",\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### リストを返す\n\nメッセージのリストを返したい場合は、`content`プロパティを持つオブジェクトを返せます：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return {\n      content: [\n        { type: \"text\", text: \"1つ目のメッセージ\" },\n        { type: \"text\", text: \"2つ目のメッセージ\" },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### 画像の返却\n\n画像のコンテンツオブジェクトを作成するには、`imageContent`を使用します：\n\n```js\nimport { imageContent } from \"fastmcp\";\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return imageContent({\n      url: \"https://example.com/image.png\",\n    });\n\n    // または...\n    // return imageContent({\n    //   path: \"/path/to/image.png\",\n    // });\n\n    // または...\n    // return imageContent({\n    //   buffer: Buffer.from(\"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\", \"base64\"),\n    // });\n\n    // または...\n    // return {\n    //   content: [\n    //     await imageContent(...)\n    //   ],\n    // };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n`imageContent`関数は以下のオプションを受け取ります：\n\n- `url`: 画像のURL\n- `path`: 画像ファイルへのパス\n- `buffer`: バッファとしての画像データ\n\n`url`、`path`、`buffer`のいずれか1つのみを指定する必要があります。\n\n上の例は以下と同等です：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: \"image\",\n          data: \"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\",\n          mimeType: \"image/png\",\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### ロギング\n\nツールはコンテキストオブジェクトの`log`を使用してクライアントにメッセージをログ出力できます：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args, { log }) => {\n    log.info(\"ファイルをダウンロード中...\", {\n      url: args.url,\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\n    log.info(\"ファイルをダウンロードしました\");\n\n    return \"完了\";\n  },\n});\n```\n\n`log`オブジェクトには以下のメソッドがあります：\n\n- `debug(message: string, data?: SerializableValue)`\n- `error(message: string, data?: SerializableValue)`\n- `info(message: string, data?: SerializableValue)`\n- `warn(message: string, data?: SerializableValue)`\n\n#### エラー\n\nユーザーに表示されるべきエラーは、`UserError`インスタンスとしてスローする必要があります：\n\n```js\nimport { UserError } from \"fastmcp\";\n\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args) => {\n    if (args.url.startsWith(\"https://example.com\")) {\n      throw new UserError(\"このURLは許可されていません\");\n    }\n\n    return \"完了\";\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### 進捗通知\n\nツールはコンテキストオブジェクトの`reportProgress`を呼び出すことで進捗を報告できます：\n\n```js\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"download\",\n  description: \"ファイルをダウンロードします\",\n  parameters: z.object({\n    url: z.string(),\n  }),\n  execute: async (args, { reportProgress }) => {\n    reportProgress({\n      progress: 0,\n      total: 100,\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\n    reportProgress({\n      progress: 100,\n      total: 100,\n    });\n\n    return \"完了\";\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### リソース\n\n[リソース](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources)は、MCPサーバーがクライアントに提供したいあらゆる種類のデータを表します。これには以下が含まれます：\n\n- ファイルの内容\n- スクリーンショットや画像\n- ログファイル\n- その他多数\n\n各リソースは一意のURIで識別され、テキストまたはバイナリデータを含むことができます。\n\n```ts\nserver.addResource({\n  uri: \"file:///logs/app.log\",\n  name: \"アプリケーションログ\",\n  mimeType: \"text/plain\",\n  async load() {\n    return {\n      text: await readLogFile(),\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> `load`は複数のリソースを返すことができます。これは例えば、ディレクトリが読み込まれたときにディレクトリ内のファイルのリストを返すために使用できます。\n>\n> ```ts\n> async load() {\n>   return [\n>     {\n>       text: \"1つ目のファイルの内容\",\n>     },\n>     {\n>       text: \"2つ目のファイルの内容\",\n>     },\n>   ];\n> }\n> ```\n\n`load`でバイナリコンテンツを返すこともできます：\n\n```ts\nasync load() {\n  return {\n    blob: 'base64でエンコードされたデータ'\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### リソーステンプレート\n\nリソーステンプレートを定義することもできます：\n\n```ts\nserver.addResourceTemplate({\n  uriTemplate: \"file:///logs/{name}.log\",\n  name: \"アプリケーションログ\",\n  mimeType: \"text/plain\",\n  arguments: [\n    {\n      name: \"name\",\n      description: \"ログの名前\",\n      required: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  async load({ name }) {\n    return {\n      text: `${name}のサンプルログ内容`,\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### リソーステンプレート引数の自動補完\n\nリソーステンプレート引数の自動補完を有効にするために、`complete`関数を提供します：\n\n```ts\nserver.addResourceTemplate({\n  uriTemplate: \"file:///logs/{name}.log\",\n  name: \"アプリケーションログ\",\n  mimeType: \"text/plain\",\n  arguments: [\n    {\n      name: \"name\",\n      description: \"ログの名前\",\n      required: true,\n      complete: async (value) => {\n        if (value === \"サンプル\") {\n          return {\n            values: [\"サンプルログ\"],\n          };\n        }\n\n        return {\n          values: [],\n        };\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n  async load({ name }) {\n    return {\n      text: `${name}のサンプルログ内容`,\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### プロンプト\n\n[プロンプト](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts)は、サーバーが再利用可能なプロンプトテンプレートとワークフローを定義し、クライアントがユーザーやLLMに簡単に提示できるようにします。これにより、一般的なLLMインタラクションを標準化して共有するための強力な方法を提供します。\n\n```ts\nserver.addPrompt({\n  name: \"git-commit\",\n  description: \"Gitコミットメッセージを生成します\",\n  arguments: [\n    {\n      name: \"changes\",\n      description: \"Gitの差分または変更の説明\",\n      required: true,\n    },\n  ],\n  load: async (args) => {\n    return `これらの変更に対する簡潔かつ説明的なコミットメッセージを生成してください：\\n\\n${args.changes}`;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### プロンプト引数の自動補完\n\nプロンプトは引数の自動補完を提供できます：\n\n```js\nserver.addPrompt({\n  name: \"countryPoem\",\n  description: \"国についての詩を書きます\",\n  load: async ({ name }) => {\n    return `こんにちは、${name}さん！`;\n  },\n  arguments: [\n    {\n      name: \"name\",\n      description: \"国の名前\",\n      required: true,\n      complete: async (value) => {\n        if (value === \"日\") {\n          return {\n            values: [\"日本\"],\n          };\n        }\n\n        return {\n          values: [],\n        };\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n#### `enum`を使用したプロンプト引数の自動補完\n\n引数に`enum`配列を提供すると、サーバーは自動的に引数の補完を提供します。\n\n```js\nserver.addPrompt({\n  name: \"countryPoem\",\n  description: \"国についての詩を書きます\",\n  load: async ({ name }) => {\n    return `こんにちは、${name}さん！`;\n  },\n  arguments: [\n    {\n      name: \"name\",\n      description: \"国の名前\",\n      required: true,\n      enum: [\"日本\", \"フランス\", \"イタリア\"],\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n### 認証\n\nFastMCPではカスタム関数を使用してクライアントを`authenticate`できます：\n\n```ts\nimport { AuthError } from \"fastmcp\";\n\nconst server = new FastMCP({\n  name: \"マイサーバー\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  authenticate: ({request}) => {\n    const apiKey = request.headers[\"x-api-key\"];\n\n    if (apiKey !== '123') {\n      throw new Response(null, {\n        status: 401,\n        statusText: \"Unauthorized\",\n      });\n    }\n\n    // ここで返すものは`context.session`オブジェクトでアクセスできます\n    return {\n      id: 1,\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\nこれで、ツール内で認証されたセッションデータにアクセスできます：\n\n```ts\nserver.addTool({\n  name: \"sayHello\",\n  execute: async (args, { session }) => {\n    return `こんにちは、${session.id}さん！`;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### セッション\n\n`session`オブジェクトは`FastMCPSession`のインスタンスであり、アクティブなクライアントセッションを記述します。\n\n```ts\nserver.sessions;\n```\n\nクライアントとサーバー間の1対1通信を可能にするために、各クライアント接続に対して新しいサーバーインスタンスを割り当てます。\n\n### 型付きサーバーイベント\n\n`on`メソッドを使用してサーバーから発行されるイベントをリッスンできます：\n\n```ts\nserver.on(\"connect\", (event) => {\n  console.log(\"クライアント接続:\", event.session);\n});\n\nserver.on(\"disconnect\", (event) => {\n  console.log(\"クライアント切断:\", event.session);\n});\n```\n\n## `FastMCPSession`\n\n`FastMCPSession`はクライアントセッションを表し、クライアントとやり取りするためのメソッドを提供します。\n\n`FastMCPSession`インスタンスの取得方法については、[セッション](#セッション)の例を参照してください。\n\n### `requestSampling`\n\n`requestSampling`は[サンプリング](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling)リクエストを作成し、レスポンスを返します。\n\n```ts\nawait session.requestSampling({\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: {\n        type: \"text\",\n        text: \"現在のディレクトリにはどのファイルがありますか？\",\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n  systemPrompt: \"あなたは役立つファイルシステムアシスタントです。\",\n  includeContext: \"thisServer\",\n  maxTokens: 100,\n});\n```\n\n### `clientCapabilities`\n\n`clientCapabilities`プロパティにはクライアント機能が含まれています。\n\n```ts\nsession.clientCapabilities;\n```\n\n### `loggingLevel`\n\n`loggingLevel`プロパティは、クライアントによって設定されたロギングレベルを記述します。\n\n```ts\nsession.loggingLevel;\n```\n\n### `roots`\n\n`roots`プロパティには、クライアントによって設定されたルートが含まれています。\n\n```ts\nsession.roots;\n```\n\n### `server`\n\n`server`プロパティには、セッションに関連付けられたMCPサーバーのインスタンスが含まれています。\n\n```ts\nsession.server;\n```\n\n### 型付きセッションイベント\n\n`on`メソッドを使用してセッションから発行されるイベントをリッスンできます：\n\n```ts\nsession.on(\"rootsChanged\", (event) => {\n  console.log(\"ルート変更:\", event.roots);\n});\n\nsession.on(\"error\", (event) => {\n  console.error(\"エラー:\", event.error);\n});\n```\n\n## サーバーの実行\n\n### MCP-CLIでテスト\n\nサーバーをテストしてデバッグする最速の方法は、`fastmcp dev`を使用することです：\n\n```bash\nnpx fastmcp dev server.js\nnpx fastmcp dev server.ts\n```\n\nこれにより、[`mcp-cli`](https://github.com/wong2/mcp-cli)を使用してターミナルでMCPサーバーをテストおよびデバッグするためのサーバーが実行されます。\n\n### MCP Inspectorで検査\n\nもう一つの方法は、公式の[`MCP Inspector`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)を使用してWebUIでサーバーを検査することです：\n\n```bash\nnpx fastmcp inspect server.ts\n```\n\n## よくある質問\n\n### Claude Desktopで使用するには？\n\nガイド https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user に従って、次の設定を追加してください：\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"my-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"tsx\",\n        \"/プロジェクトへのパス/src/index.ts\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"環境変数名\": \"値\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 事例紹介\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n>
