It provides tools for analyzing protein active sites and searching for disease-related proteins by interfacing with established protein databases. \n\nFuture work will be centered around enabling agents to utilize the BioMCP.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Active Site Analysis**: Examine the binding sites and functional residues of proteins using PDB IDs\n- **Disease-Protein Search**: Find protein structures associated with specific diseases or medical conditions\n- **Integrated Data Access**: Connect seamlessly with RCSB Protein Data Bank [(PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nBioMCP implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing language models to access specialized protein structure knowledge without requiring this information to be part of their training data. The server handles API connections, data formatting, and error handling to provide reliable protein structure insights.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\nBioMCP exposes two primary tools:\n\n1. `analyze-active-site`: Provides detailed information about protein binding sites using a PDB ID\n2. `search-disease-proteins`: Returns proteins related to specified diseases or medical conditions\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install BioMCP for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@acashmoney/bio-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @acashmoney/bio-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/acashmoney/bio-mcp.git\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Start the server\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Running the MCP Inspector\n\n1. Start the BioMCP server:\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n2. In a separate terminal, install the MCP Inspector globally (if not already installed):\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-inspector\n   ```\n\n3. Launch the MCP Inspector and connect to your local BioMCP server:\n   ```bash\n   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js\n   ```\n\n4. Use the inspector interface to test tools and view responses.\n\n### Using with Claude Desktop\n\n1. Build the BioMCP server:\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n2. Configure Claude Desktop to launch the MCP server:\n\n   a. Locate your Claude Desktop config.json file (typically in your user directory)\n   \n   b. Edit the config.json to include the BioMCP server build path. Example configuration:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"globalShortcut\": \"\",\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"bio-mcp\": {\n         \"command\": \"node\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/build/index.js\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   c. Replace `/path/to/your/build` with your actual path to the project directory.\n\n3. Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.\n\n4. You can now ask Claude questions that utilize the BioMCP tools:\n   - \"What are the key residues in the active site of PDB structure 6LU7?\"\n   - \"Find proteins related to Alzheimer's disease\"\n\n## Example Usage\n\nWhen integrated with a compatible language model, Bio-MCP enables queries like:\n\n- \"What are the key residues in the active site of PDB structure 6LU7?\"\n- \"Find proteins related to Alzheimer's disease\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher\n- TypeScript 5.0+\n- Compatible MCP client implementation\n\n## Testing\n\nBioMCP includes a comprehensive testing suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nRun all tests:\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nRun specific test suites:\n```bash\n# Unit tests only\nnpm run test:unit\n\n# Integration tests only (API interactions)\nnpm run test:integration\n\n# End-to-end tests only\nnpm run test:e2e\n```\n\n### Linting\n\nCheck code quality:\n```bash\nnpm run lint\n```\n\nFix linting issues automatically:\n```bash\nnpm run lint:fix\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Expand level of detail for active site descriptions\n- Leverage 3-D coordinates\n- Tools for interfacing with literature\n- Tools for interfacing with computational biology models:\n  - RFdiffusion\n  - ProteinMPNN\n  - ColabFold\n  - Additional protein design and structure prediction tools\n- Agent-based research pipelines\n- Introduce client with protein visualization tools\n",

This repository contains the code used in the paper Automated medical coding on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV: A Critical Review and Replicability Study. The repository contains code for training and evaluating medical coding models and new splits for MIMIC-III and the newly released MIMIC-IV. The following models have been implemented:\n\n| Model | Paper | Original Code |\n| ----- | ----- | ------------- |\n| CNN   |[Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes from Clinical Text](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1100/) | [link](https://github.com/jamesmullenbach/caml-mimic) | \n| Bi-GRU|[Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes from Clinical Text](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1100/) | [link](https://github.com/jamesmullenbach/caml-mimic) | \n|CAML   |[Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes from Clinical Text](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1100/) | [link](https://github.com/jamesmullenbach/caml-mimic) | \n| MultiResCNN | [ICD Coding from Clinical Text Using Multi-Filter Residual Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00862.pdf) | [link](https://github.com/foxlf823/Multi-Filter-Residual-Convolutional-Neural-Network) |\n| LAAT | [A Label Attention Model for ICD Coding from Clinical Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06351) | [link](https://github.com/aehrc/LAAT) |\n| PLM-ICD | [PLM-ICD: Automatic ICD Coding with Pretrained Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.clinicalnlp-1.2/) | [link](https://github.com/MiuLab/PLM-ICD) |\n\nThe splits are found in `files/data`. The splits are described in the paper.\n\n## How to reproduce results\n### Setup Conda environment\n1. Create a conda environement `conda create -n coding python=3.10`\n2. Install the packages `pip install . -e`\n\n### Prepare MIMIC-III\nThis code has been developed on MIMIC-III v1.4. \n1. Download the MIMIC-III data into your preferred location `path/to/mimiciii`. Please note that you need to complete training to acces the data. The training is free, but takes a couple of hours.  - [link to data access](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)\n2. Open the file `src/settings.py`\n3. Change the variable `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_MIMICIII` to the path of your downloaded data `path/to/mimiciii`\n4. If you want to use the MIMIC-III full and MIMIC-III 50 from the [Explainable Prediction of Medical Codes from Clinical Text](https://aclanthology.org/N18-1100/) you need to run `python prepare_data/prepare_mimiciii_mullenbach.py`\n5. If you want to use MIMIC-III clean from our paper you need to run `python prepare_data/prepare_mimiciii.py`\n\n### Prepare MIMIC-IV\nThis code has been developed on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV v2.2. \n1. Download MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-NOTE into your preferred location `path/to/mimiciv` and `path/to/mimiciv-note`. Please note that you need to complete training to acces the data. The training is free, but takes a couple of hours.  - [mimiciv](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) and [mimiciv-note](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-note/2.2/)\n2. Open the file `src/settings.py`\n3. Change the variable `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_MIMICIV` to the path of your downloaded data `path/to/mimiciv`\n4. Change the variable `DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY_MIMICIV_NOTE` to the path of your downloaded data `path/to/mimiciv-note`\n5. Run `python prepare_data/prepare_mimiciv.py`\n\n### Before running experiments\n1. Create a weights and biases account. It is possible to run the experiments without wandb.\n2. Download the [model checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hYeJhztAd-JbhqHojY7ZpLtkBcthD8AK/view?usp=share_link) and unzip it. Please note that these model weights can't be used commercially due to the MIMIC License.\n3. If you want to train PLM-ICD, you need to download [RoBERTa-base-PM-M3-Voc](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/biolm/RoBERTa-base-PM-M3-Voc-hf.tar.gz), unzip it and change the `model_path` parameter in `configs/model/plm_icd.yaml` and `configs/text_transform\n/huggingface.yaml` to the path of the download. \n\n### Running experiments\n#### Training\nYou can run any experiment found in `configs/experiment`. Here are some examples:\n   * Train PLM-ICD on MIMIC-III clean on GPU 0: `python main.py experiment=mimiciii_clean/plm_icd gpu=0`\n   * Train CAML on MIMIC-III full on GPU 6: `python main.py experiment=mimiciii_full/caml gpu=6`\n   * Train LAAT on MIMIC-IV ICD-9 full on GPU 6: `python main.py experiment=mimiciv_icd9/laat gpu=6`\n   * Train LAAT on MIMIC-IV ICD-9 full on GPU 6 without weights and biases: `python main.py experiment=mimiciv_icd9/laat gpu=6 callbacks=no_wandb trainer.print_metrics=true`\n   \n#### Evaluation\nIf you just want to evaluate the models using the provided model_checkpoints you need to do set `trainer.epochs=0` and provide the path to the models checkpoint `load_model=path/to/model_checkpoint`. Make sure you the correct model-checkpoint with the correct configs.\n\nExample:\nEvaluate PLM-ICD on MIMIC-IV ICD-10 on GPU 1: `python main.py experiment=mimiciv_icd10/plm_icd gpu=1 load_model=path/to/model_checkpoints/mimiciv_icd10/plm_icd trainer.epochs=0`\n\n## Overview of the repository\n#### configs\nWe use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for configurations. The condigs for every experiment is found in `configs/experiments`. Furthermore, the configuration for the sweeps are found in `configs/sweeps`. We used [Weights and Biases Sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps) for most of our experiments.\n\n#### files\nThis is where the images and data is stored.\n\n#### notebooks\nThe directory only contains one notebook used for the code analysis. The notebook is not aimed to be used by others, but is included for others to validate our data analysis.\n\n#### prepare_data\nThe directory contains all the code for preparing the datasets and generating splits.\n\n#### reports\nThis is the code used to generate the plots and tables used in the paper. The code uses the Weights and Biases API to fetch the experiment results. The code is not usable by others, but was included for the possibility to validate our figures and tables.\n\n#### src\nThis is were the code for running the experiments is found.\n\n#### tests\nThe directory contains the unit tests\n\n## My setup\nI ran the experiments on one RTX 2080 Ti 11GB per experiment. I had 128 GB RAM on my machine.\n\n## ⚠️ Known issues \n* LAAT and PLM-ICD are unstable. The loss will sometimes diverge during training. The issue seems to be overflow in the softmax function in the label-wise attention. Using batch norm or layer norm before the softmax function might solve the issue. We did not try to fix the issue as we didn't want to change the original method during our reproducibility.\n* The code was only tested on a server with 128 GB RAM. A user with 32 GB RAM reported issues fitting MIMIC-IV into memory.\n* There is an error in the collate function in the Huggingface dataset. The attention mask is being padded with 1s instead of 0s. I have not fixed this issue because I want people to be able to reproduce the results from the paper.\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThank you Sotiris Lamprinidis for providing an efficient implementation of our multi-label stratification algorithm and some data preprocessing helper functions.\n",

Adapt the configuration or keep as is for compatibility with the sample ORTHANC  Server.\n\n```yaml\nnodes:\n  main:\n    host: \"localhost\"\n    port: 4242 \n    ae_title: \"ORTHANC\"\n    description: \"Local Orthanc DICOM server\"\n\ncurrent_node: \"main\"\ncalling_aet: \"MCPSCU\" \n```\n> [!WARNING]\nDICOM-MCP is not meant for clinical use, and should not be connected with live hospital databases or databases with patient-sensitive data. Doing so could lead to both loss of patient data, and leakage of patient data onto the internet. DICOM-MCP can be used with locally hosted open-weight LLMs for complete data privacy. \n\n### (Optional) Sample ORTHANC server\nIf you don't have a DICOM server available, you can run a local ORTHANC server using Docker:\n\nClone the repository and install test dependencies `pip install -e \".[dev]`\n\n```bash\ncd tests\ndocker ocmpose up -d\ncd ..\npytest # uploads dummy pdf data to ORTHANC server\n```\nUI at [http://localhost:8042](http://localhost:8042)\n\n### 🔌 MCP Integration\n\nAdd to your client configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"dicom\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\"tool\",\"dicom-mcp\", \"/path/to/your_config.yaml\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor development:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"arxiv-mcp-server\": {\n            \"command\": \"uv\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"--directory\",\n                \"path/to/cloned/dicom-mcp\",\n                \"run\",\n                \"dicom-mcp\",\n                \"/path/to/your_config.yaml\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n## 🛠️ Tools Overview\n\n`dicom-mcp` provides four categories of tools for interaction with DICOM servers and DICOM data. \n\n### 🔍 Query Metadata\n\n* **`query_patients`**: Search for patients based on criteria like name, ID, or birth date.\n* **`query_studies`**: Find studies using patient ID, date, modality, description, accession number, or Study UID.\n* **`query_series`**: Locate series within a specific study using modality, series number/description, or Series UID.\n* **`query_instances`**: Find individual instances (images/objects) within a series using instance number or SOP Instance UID\n### 📄 Read DICOM Reports (PDF)\n\n* **`extract_pdf_text_from_dicom`**: Retrieve a specific DICOM instance containing an encapsulated PDF and extract its text content.\n\n### ➡️ Send DICOM Images\n\n* **`move_series`**: Send a specific DICOM series to another configured DICOM node using C-MOVE.\n* **`move_study`**: Send an entire DICOM study to another configured DICOM node using C-MOVE.\n\n### ⚙️ Utilities\n\n* **`list_dicom_nodes`**: Show the currently active DICOM node and list all configured nodes.\n* **`switch_dicom_node`**: Change the active DICOM node for subsequent operations.\n* **`verify_connection`**: Test the DICOM network connection to the currently active node using C-ECHO.\n* **`get_attribute_presets`**: List the available levels of detail (minimal, standard, extended) for metadata query results.<p>\n\n\n### Example interaction\nThe tools can be chained together to answer complex questions:\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"images/example.png\" alt=\"My Awesome Diagram\" width=\"700\">\n</div>\n\n\n## 📈 Contributing\n### Running Tests\n\nTests require a running Orthanc DICOM server. You can use Docker:\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to the directory containing docker-compose.yml (e.g., tests/)\ncd tests\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nRun tests using pytest:\n\n```bash\n# From the project root directory\npytest\n```\n\nStop the Orthanc container:\n\n```bash\ncd tests\ndocker-compose down\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nUse the MCP Inspector for debugging the server communication:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run dicom-mcp /path/to/your_config.yaml --transport stdio\n```\n\n## 🙏 Acknowledgments\n\n* Built using [pynetdicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pynetdicom)\n* Uses [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for PDF text extraction\n",

While advanced models from Claude, OpenAI, and others can perform adequately in medical contexts, their responses often lack grounding in factual information and published references. Additionally, India faces a significant challenge with the absence of centralized repositories for branded medications in the public domain.\n\nThe Eka MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing structured access to curated knowledge-bases through specialized tools:\n\n* **Indian Branded Drug Search**: Enables lookup across 500,000+ branded drugs available in India, returning comprehensive metadata including generic composition and manufacturer information to enhance LLM responses.\n* **Indian Treatment Protocol Search**: Provides contextual access to over 180 treatment protocol documents published by authoritative Indian healthcare institutions such as ICMR and RSSDI.\n\n\nKey Benefits:\n* 🩺 Medical Accuracy: Grounds AI responses in verified healthcare information\n* 🔄 Seamless Workflow: Provides critical information without requiring context switching\n* 🛡️ Reduced Hallucinations: Relies on curated medical data rather than AI's implicit general knowledge\n* 🌐 Open Ecosystem: Integrates with the growing MCP open standard\n\n# Get Started\n## Get your developer key from eka.care\n> [!NOTE]  \n> To obtain the `client-id`, and `client-token` reach out to us on ekaconnect@eka.care\n\n\n## Installation and Setup for Claude Desktop\n1. Install UV - https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods\n2. Install Claude desktop application - https://claude.ai/download\n3. Locate the configuration file:\n   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   \n   In case the file does not exist, create a new file named `claude_desktop_config.json` in the above directory.\n4. Modify/Create the configuration file with the following settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"eka-mcp-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"eka_mcp_server\",\n        \"--eka-api-host\",\n        \"https://api.eka.care\",\n        \"--client-id\",\n        \"<client_id>\",\n        \"--client-secret\",\n        \"<client_secret>\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n5. Replace the placeholder values:\n   - `<client_id>`: Your client ID\n   - `<client_secret>`: Your client secret\n\n## Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging experience, we recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx eka_mcp_server --eka-api-host https://api.eka.care --client-id <client_id> --client-secret <client_secret>\n```\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\n## Troubleshooting common issues\n\n### spawn uvx ENOENT\nThis commonly happens when uvx is not installed or the command cannot be discovered.\n![spawn uvx ENOENT screenshot](assets/uvx_debug.png)\n\n\n1. Install uv through this command \n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n2.

Install UV (required):\n   ```bash\n   pip install uv\n   ```\n   Make sure `uv` is available in your system PATH as it's required for Claude to properly execute the server.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to set up the server:\n\n### 1. Traditional Setup\n\nInstall the required dependencies:\n\n```bash\nuv pip install mcp[cli]\n```\n\n### 2. MCP Installation (Recommended)\n\nTo use this server with Claude's Model Context Protocol:\n\n```bash\nmcp install server.py\n```\n\nThis will register the server with Claude for DICOM operations.\n\n## Running the Server\n\n### Direct Execution\n\n```bash\nuv run server.py\n```\n\n### Through Claude\n\nOnce installed via MCP, the server will be automatically managed by Claude when needed.\n\nThe server will start on 0.0.0.0:8080 by default.\n\n## Node Configuration\n\nThe server uses a `nodes.yaml` file to store DICOM node configurations. This allows you to:\n\n1. List all configured DICOM nodes\n2. Perform C-ECHO operations using node names instead of explicit AE titles, IPs, and ports\n3. Use different local AE titles for C-ECHO operations\n\n### nodes.yaml Format\n\n```yaml\nnodes:\n  # Example node configuration\n  main_pacs:\n    ae_title: DESTINATION\n    ip: 192.168.1.100\n    port: 104\n    description: \"Main hospital PACS system\"\n\nlocal_ae_titles:\n  - name: default\n    ae_title: MCP_DICOM\n    description: \"Default AE title for MCP DICOM server\"\n  \n  - name: pacs_gateway\n    ae_title: PACS_GATEWAY\n    description: \"PACS Gateway AE title\"\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter the \"spawn uv ENOENT\" error, it typically means one of the following:\n\n1. UV is not installed or not in your PATH\n2. The Python executable cannot be found by the MCP client\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. Make sure UV is properly installed and in your PATH:\n   ```bash\n   which uv  # Should show the path to UV\n   ```\n\n2. Ensure you're using a Python environment that's accessible to the system:\n   - If using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated\n   - Check that Python is in your PATH\n\n3. Try running the server with explicit UV path:\n   ```bash\n   /full/path/to/uv run server.py\n   ```\n\n4. Add more debugging by checking the stderr output in the logs\n\n## Usage\n\nThe server provides several DICOM tools that can be used through the MCP interface:\n\n### List DICOM Nodes\n\nList all configured DICOM nodes from the nodes.yaml file:\n\n```\nlist_dicom_nodes()\n```\n\n### C-ECHO by Node Name\n\nPerform a C-ECHO operation using a node name from the configuration:\n\n```\ndicom_cecho_by_name(node_name=\"main_pacs\", local_ae_name=\"default\")\n```\n\n### Direct C-ECHO\n\nPerform a C-ECHO operation with explicit parameters:\n\n```\ndicom_cecho(remote_ae_title=\"REMOTE_AE\", ip=\"192.168.1.100\", port=104, local_ae_title=\"MCP_DICOM\")\n```\n",

      "readme_content": "# BioMCP: Biomedical Model Context Protocol\n\nBioMCP is an open source (MIT License) toolkit that empowers AI assistants and\nagents with specialized biomedical knowledge. Built following the Model Context\nProtocol (MCP), it connects AI systems to authoritative biomedical data\nsources, enabling them to answer questions about clinical trials, scientific\nliterature, and genomic variants with precision and depth.\n\n[![▶️ Watch the video](./docs/blog/images/what_is_biomcp_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKxOWrWUUhM)\n\n## MCPHub Certification\n\nBioMCP is certified by [MCPHub](https://mcphub.com/mcp-servers/genomoncology/biomcp). This certification ensures that BioMCP follows best practices for Model Context Protocol implementation and provides reliable biomedical data access.\n\n## Why BioMCP?\n\nWhile Large Language Models have broad general knowledge, they often lack\nspecialized domain-specific information or access to up-to-date resources.\nBioMCP bridges this gap for biomedicine by:\n\n- Providing **structured access** to clinical trials, biomedical literature,\n  and genomic variants\n- Enabling **natural language queries** to specialized databases without\n  requiring knowledge of their specific syntax\n- Supporting **biomedical research** workflows through a consistent interface\n- Functioning as an **MCP server** for AI assistants and agents\n\n## Biomedical Data Sources\n\nBioMCP integrates with multiple biomedical data sources:\n\n### Literature Sources\n\n- **PubTator3/PubMed** - Peer-reviewed biomedical literature with entity annotations\n- **bioRxiv/medRxiv** - Preprint servers for biology and health sciences\n- **Europe PMC** - Open science platform including preprints\n\n### Clinical & Genomic Sources\n\n- **ClinicalTrials.gov** - Clinical trial registry and results database\n- **NCI Clinical Trials Search API** - National Cancer Institute's curated cancer trials database\n  - Advanced search filters (biomarkers, prior therapies, brain metastases)\n  - Organization and intervention databases\n  - Disease vocabulary with synonyms\n- **BioThings Suite** - Comprehensive biomedical data APIs:\n  - **MyVariant.info** - Consolidated genetic variant annotation\n  - **MyGene.info** - Real-time gene annotations and information\n  - **MyDisease.info** - Disease ontology and synonym information\n  - **MyChem.info** - Drug/chemical annotations and properties\n- **TCGA/GDC** - The Cancer Genome Atlas for cancer variant data\n- **1000 Genomes** - Population frequency data via Ensembl\n- **cBioPortal** - Cancer genomics portal with mutation occurrence data\n\n### Regulatory & Safety Sources\n\n- **OpenFDA** - FDA regulatory and safety data:\n  - **Drug Adverse Events (FAERS)** - Post-market drug safety reports\n  - **Drug Labels (SPL)** - Official prescribing information\n  - **Device Events (MAUDE)** - Medical device adverse events, with genomic device filtering\n\n## Available MCP Tools\n\nBioMCP provides 24 specialized tools for biomedical research:\n\n### Core Tools (3)\n\n#### 1. Think Tool (ALWAYS USE FIRST!)\n\n**CRITICAL**: The `think` tool MUST be your first step for ANY biomedical research task.\n\n```python\n# Start analysis with sequential thinking\nthink(\n    thought=\"Breaking down the query about BRAF mutations in melanoma...\",\n    thoughtNumber=1,\n    totalThoughts=3,\n    nextThoughtNeeded=True\n)\n```\n\nThe sequential thinking tool helps:\n\n- Break down complex biomedical problems systematically\n- Plan multi-step research approaches\n- Track reasoning progress\n- Ensure comprehensive analysis\n\n#### 2. Search Tool\n\nThe search tool supports two modes:\n\n##### Unified Query Language (Recommended)\n\nUse the `query` parameter with structured field syntax for powerful cross-domain searches:\n\n```python\n# Simple natural language\nsearch(query=\"BRAF melanoma\")\n\n# Field-specific search\nsearch(query=\"gene:BRAF AND trials.condition:melanoma\")\n\n# Complex queries\nsearch(query=\"gene:BRAF AND variants.significance:pathogenic AND articles.date:>2023\")\n\n# Get searchable fields schema\nsearch(get_schema=True)\n\n# Explain how a query is parsed\nsearch(query=\"gene:BRAF\", explain_query=True)\n```\n\n**Supported Fields:**\n\n- **Cross-domain**: `gene:`, `variant:`, `disease:`\n- **Trials**: `trials.condition:`, `trials.phase:`, `trials.status:`, `trials.intervention:`\n- **Articles**: `articles.author:`, `articles.journal:`, `articles.date:`\n- **Variants**: `variants.significance:`, `variants.rsid:`, `variants.frequency:`\n\n##### Domain-Based Search\n\nUse the `domain` parameter with specific filters:\n\n```python\n# Search articles (includes automatic cBioPortal integration)\nsearch(domain=\"article\", genes=[\"BRAF\"], diseases=[\"melanoma\"])\n\n# Search with mutation-specific cBioPortal data\nsearch(domain=\"article\", genes=[\"BRAF\"], keywords=[\"V600E\"])\nsearch(domain=\"article\", genes=[\"SRSF2\"], keywords=[\"F57*\"])  # Wildcard patterns\n\n# Search trials\nsearch(domain=\"trial\", conditions=[\"lung cancer\"], phase=\"3\")\n\n# Search variants\nsearch(domain=\"variant\", gene=\"TP53\", significance=\"pathogenic\")\n```\n\n**Note**: When searching articles with a gene parameter, cBioPortal data is automatically included:\n\n- Gene-level summaries show mutation frequency across cancer studies\n- Mutation-specific searches (e.g., \"V600E\") show study-level occurrence data\n- Cancer types are dynamically resolved from cBioPortal API\n\n#### 3. Fetch Tool\n\nRetrieve full details for a single article, trial, or variant:\n\n```python\n# Fetch article details (supports both PMID and DOI)\nfetch(domain=\"article\", id=\"34567890\")  # PMID\nfetch(domain=\"article\", id=\"10.1101/2024.01.20.23288905\")  # DOI\n\n# Fetch trial with all sections\nfetch(domain=\"trial\", id=\"NCT04280705\", detail=\"all\")\n\n# Fetch variant details\nfetch(domain=\"variant\", id=\"rs113488022\")\n```\n\n**Domain-specific options:**\n\n- **Articles**: `detail=\"full\"` retrieves full text if available\n- **Trials**: `detail` can be \"protocol\", \"locations\", \"outcomes\", \"references\", or \"all\"\n- **Variants**: Always returns full details\n\n### Individual Tools (21)\n\nFor users who prefer direct access to specific functionality, BioMCP also provides 21 individual tools:\n\n#### Article Tools (2)\n\n- **article_searcher**: Search PubMed/PubTator3 and preprints\n- **article_getter**: Fetch detailed article information (supports PMID and DOI)\n\n#### Trial Tools (5)\n\n- **trial_searcher**: Search ClinicalTrials.gov or NCI CTS API (via source parameter)\n- **trial_getter**: Fetch all trial details from either source\n- **trial_protocol_getter**: Fetch protocol information only (ClinicalTrials.gov)\n- **trial_references_getter**: Fetch trial publications (ClinicalTrials.gov)\n- **trial_outcomes_getter**: Fetch outcome measures and results (ClinicalTrials.gov)\n- **trial_locations_getter**: Fetch site locations and contacts (ClinicalTrials.gov)\n\n#### Variant Tools (2)\n\n- **variant_searcher**: Search MyVariant.info database\n- **variant_getter**: Fetch comprehensive variant details\n\n#### NCI-Specific Tools (6)\n\n- **nci_organization_searcher**: Search NCI's organization database\n- **nci_organization_getter**: Get organization details by ID\n- **nci_intervention_searcher**: Search NCI's intervention database (drugs, devices, procedures)\n- **nci_intervention_getter**: Get intervention details by ID\n- **nci_biomarker_searcher**: Search biomarkers used in trial eligibility criteria\n- **nci_disease_searcher**: Search NCI's controlled vocabulary of cancer conditions\n\n#### Gene, Disease & Drug Tools (3)\n\n- **gene_getter**: Get real-time gene information from MyGene.info\n- **disease_getter**: Get disease definitions and synonyms from MyDisease.info\n- **drug_getter**: Get drug/chemical information from MyChem.info\n\n**Note**: All individual tools that search by gene automatically include cBioPortal summaries when the `include_cbioportal` parameter is True (default). Trial searches can expand disease conditions with synonyms when `expand_synonyms` is True (default).\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### For Claude Desktop Users\n\n1. **Install `uv`** if you don't have it (recommended):\n\n   ```bash\n   #

      "readme_content": "# 🩺 Med AI Insight Viewer\n\n**A web application leveraging AI to analyze medical images and provide insightful descriptions.**\n\nThis application allows users to securely upload medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, etc.) and receive AI-generated analysis, including potential observations and structured descriptions. It utilizes OpenAI's vision capabilities via Supabase Edge Functions for analysis, along with Supabase for authentication and data persistence.\n\n---\n\n<!-- Add a screenshot or GIF demo here -->\n<!-- ![App Screenshot](link/to/screenshot.png) -->\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n*   **Secure User Authentication:** Google OAuth login via Supabase Auth ensures user data privacy.\n*   **Easy Image Upload:** Simple drag-and-drop or file selection interface for medical images.\n*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes OpenAI's advanced vision models (e.g., `gpt-4-vision-preview`) to interpret images.\n*   **Structured Results:** Provides analysis in a clear format (e.g., description, potential findings, comments).\n*   **Analysis History:** Stores past analyses for user reference, secured by Row Level Security (RLS).\n*   **Responsive UI:** Built with Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for a clean experience on desktop and mobile.\n\n## 🚀 Tech Stack\n\n*   **Frontend:**\n    *   Framework: React (Vite)\n    *   Language: TypeScript\n    *   UI Library: Shadcn/ui\n    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS\n    *   Routing: React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`)\n    *   State Management: React Context, `useState`, Supabase Auth Helpers\n    *   Notifications: `react-hot-toast` (via `useToast` hook), `sonner`\n    *   Markdown Rendering: `markdown-to-jsx`\n*   **Backend:**\n    *   Platform: Supabase\n    *   Authentication: Supabase Auth (Google OAuth configured)\n    *   Database: Supabase PostgreSQL\n    *   Serverless Functions: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno Runtime)\n*   **AI:**\n    *   Model Provider: OpenAI\n    *   API Interaction: Via Supabase Edge Function\n\n## 📁 Project Structure\n\n.\n├── public/ # Static assets (icons, robots.txt)\n├── src/ # Frontend React application source\n│ ├── components/ # Reusable React components\n│ │ ├── ui/ # Shadcn UI components\n│ │ ├── AnalysisResult.tsx # Displays AI analysis results\n│ │ ├── ApiKeyInput.tsx # (Legacy/Client-side check - Not used for Backend API call)\n│ │ ├── Header.tsx # Application header with navigation/logout\n│ │ ├── HistoryList.tsx # Displays list of past analyses\n│ │ └── ImageUpload.tsx # Handles image selection and preview\n│ ├── hooks/ # Custom React hooks (use-toast, use-mobile)\n│ ├── lib/ # Utility functions (cn)\n│ ├── pages/ # Top-level route components (Index, Dashboard, NotFound)\n│ ├── types/ # TypeScript type definitions\n│ ├── utils/ # Utility functions for external services (openai.ts - calls backend)\n│ ├── App.css # Basic App styles (potentially removable)\n│ ├── App.tsx # Main application component, routing, Supabase context\n│ ├── index.css # Tailwind directives and base styles\n│ ├── main.tsx # Application entry point\n│ └── vite-env.d.ts # Vite TypeScript env declarations\n├── supabase/ # Supabase backend configuration and code\n│ ├── functions/ # Supabase Edge Functions\n│ │ ├── _shared/ # Shared code for functions (cors.ts)\n│ │ └── analyze-image/ # Edge Function for OpenAI image analysis\n│ │ └── index.ts\n│ └── migrations/ # Database schema migrations (.sql)\n├── .gitignore # Git ignore rules\n├── components.json # Shadcn UI configuration\n├── eslint.config.js # ESLint configuration\n├── index.html # Main HTML entry point for Vite\n├── package.json # Project dependencies and scripts\n├── postcss.config.js # PostCSS configuration\n├── README.md # This file\n├── tailwind.config.ts # Tailwind CSS configuration\n├── tsconfig.app.json # TypeScript config for the app\n├── tsconfig.json # Base TypeScript config\n├── tsconfig.node.json # TypeScript config for Node env (Vite config)\n└── vite.config.ts # Vite build configuration\n\n\n## ⚙️ Core Functionality & Workflow\n\n1.  **Authentication (`src/App.tsx`, `src/pages/Index.tsx`):**\n    *   Users land on the `Index` page.\n    *   Clicking \"Get Started\" initiates the Supabase Google OAuth flow.\n    *   Upon successful login, Supabase redirects back to the app (specifically `/dashboard` as configured in the OAuth options).\n    *   The `RequireAuth` component in `App.tsx` verifies the Supabase session using `useSession`. Authenticated users can access `/dashboard`; others are redirected to `/`.\n    *   The `Header` component provides a logout button which calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`.\n\n2.  **Image Upload (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`):**\n    *   On the `Dashboard`, the `ImageUpload` component allows users to drag & drop or select an image file.\n    *   A preview of the selected image is displayed.\n    *   The selected `File` object and a base64 representation (`imagePreview`) are stored in the `Dashboard` component's state.\n\n3.  **Analysis Process:**\n    *   **Trigger:** The user clicks the \"Analyze Image\" button on the `Dashboard`.\n    *   **Frontend (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/utils/openai.ts`):**\n        *   The `analyzeImage` function in `Dashboard.tsx` is called.\n        *   It calls the utility function `analyzeImageApi` from `src/utils/openai.ts`.\n        *   `analyzeImageApi` gets the current Supabase session token.\n        *   It makes a `POST` request to the Supabase Edge Function endpoint (`/functions/v1/analyze-image`).\n        *   The request includes the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and a JSON body containing `imageBase64` and `imageType`.\n        *   It handles the response from the Edge Function.\n    *   **Backend (`supabase/functions/analyze-image/index.ts`):**\n        *   The Edge Function receives the request.\n        *   It validates the incoming JWT using the Supabase client initialized with the user's token.\n        *   It retrieves the **securely stored OpenAI API key** from the Edge Function's environment variables (`Deno.env.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')`). **The client-side key is NOT used here.**\n        *   It formats the `imageBase64` string into a data URL if necessary.\n        *   It constructs a request to the OpenAI API (`gpt-4.1-mini` or similar vision model specified in the function), sending the image URL and a specific prompt asking for medical observations/hypothetical diagnosis.\n        *   It receives the analysis text from OpenAI.\n        *   It structures the response into the `AnalysisResultType` format, adding a timestamp.\n        *   It saves the `imageType` and the structured `result` (as JSONB) to the `users_history` table in the Supabase database, linking it to the authenticated `user_id`.\n        *   It returns the newly created database record (containing the result) to the frontend.\n    *   **Frontend (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):**\n        *   Receives the analysis result from the utility function.\n        *   Updates the `analysisResult` state variable.\n        *   Displays a success toast notification.\n        *   The `AnalysisResult` component re-renders to display the new data.\n\n4.  **Result Display (`src/components/AnalysisResult.tsx`):**\n    *   Renders the `AnalysisResultType` data passed via props.\n    *   Displays the image preview alongside the AI-generated content.\n    *   Uses `markdown-to-jsx` to render the analysis content, allowing for formatted text from the AI.\n    *   Includes a crucial disclaimer about the analysis not being professional medical advice.\n\n5.  **History (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/components/HistoryList.tsx`):**\n    *   The \"History\" tab on the `Dashboard` renders the `HistoryList` component.\n    *   `HistoryList` uses the Supabase JS client (`useSupabaseClient`) to fetch records from the `users_history` table, ordered by creation date.\n    *   Supabase RLS policies ensure only the currently logged-in user's history is returned.\n    *   Displays a list of past analyses, showing image type, a snippet of the diagnosis, and timestamp.\n\n## 💾 Backend Details\n\n### Supabase Edge Function (`analyze-image`)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Securely interacts with the OpenAI API using a server-side secret key and stores results.\n*   **Trigger:** HTTP POST request to `/functions/v1/analyze-image`.\n*   **Authentication:** Requires a valid Supabase JWT in the `Authorization` header.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Requires `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in the Edge Function settings.\n*   **Input:** JSON `{ imageBase64: string, imageType: string }`.\n*   **Processing:**\n    1.  Authenticates user via JWT.\n    2.  Retrieves `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret.\n    3.  Calls OpenAI Chat Completions API with vision model.\n    4.  Parses OpenAI response.\n    5.  Inserts result into `users_history` table using the authenticated user's ID.\n*   **Output:** JSON containing the newly created database entry (`{ result: UserHistoryItem }`).\n\n### Supabase Database Schema (`users_history`)\n\n*   **Table:** `public.users_history`\n*   **Purpose:** Stores the results of image analyses linked to users.\n*   **Columns:**\n    *   `id` (uuid, PK): Unique identifier for the history entry.\n    *   `user_id` (uuid, FK -> `auth.users`): Links the entry to the authenticated user.\n    *   `image_url` (text, nullable): *Currently seems unused in the primary analysis flow which uses base64.* Could be used if storing uploaded images directly.\n    *   `image_type` (text, not null): Type of the analyzed image (e.g., \"X-ray\", \"MRI\").\n    *   `result` (jsonb, not null): Stores the structured `AnalysisResultType` object returned by the AI.\n    *   `created_at` (timestamptz, default now()): Timestamp of when the analysis was performed.\n*   **Row Level Security (RLS):**\n    *   **Enabled:** Yes.\n    *   **Policies:**\n        *   Users can `SELECT` only their own history records (`auth.uid() = user_id`).\n        *   Users can `INSERT` only records where `user_id` matches their own `auth.uid()`.\n\n## 🛠️ Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)\n*   npm, yarn, or pnpm\n*   Git\n*   Supabase Account\n*   Supabase CLI (Optional, for local development)\n*   OpenAI API Key\n\n### Installation & Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd med-ai-insight-viewer\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    # or yarn install or pnpm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**\n    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.\n    *   Add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key:\n        ```env\n        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL\n        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY\n        ```\n    *   You can find these in your Supabase project settings (Project Settings > API).\n\n4.  **Supabase Setup:**\n    *   **Option A: Supabase Cloud (Recommended for deployment)**\n        1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.\n        2.  **Authentication:** Navigate to Authentication > Providers and enable the \"Google\" provider. Add your Google Cloud OAuth credentials. Ensure you add your app's URL(s) (including localhost for development) to the \"Redirect URLs\" section in Supabase Auth settings *and* in your Google Cloud OAuth configuration.\n        3.  **Database:** Navigate to the SQL Editor. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250421000000_initial_schema.sql` and run it to create the `users_history` table and RLS policies.\n        4.  **Edge Functions:**\n            *   Navigate to Edge Functions.\n            *   Deploy the `analyze-image` function (e.g., using `supabase functions deploy analyze-image --no-verify-jwt` if testing locally first, or set up CI/CD).\n            *   Go to the `analyze-image` function's settings > Secrets and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n    *   **Option B: Supabase Local Development**\n        1.  Initialize Supabase locally: `supabase init`\n        2.  Start Supabase services: `supabase start`\n        3.  Apply database migrations: `supabase db push` (or link your project `supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>` and pull schema changes if needed).\n        4.  Set Edge Function secrets locally: `supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`\n        5.  (You'll need to configure Google Auth locally or use email/password for testing if not using the cloud setup).

The implementation allows users to create their own private Blossom servers on AWS EC2 instances.\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1. **Install AWS SDK**:\n   ```\n   npm install @aws-sdk/client-ec2\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Security Groups**:\n   The `scripts/create_aws_security_groups.js` script will create the necessary security groups in each AWS region:\n   ```\n   node scripts/create_aws_security_groups.js\n   ```\n   Make sure to update the VPC ID in the script for each region.\n\n3. **Configure AWS Credentials**:\n   Create a `.env` file with the following variables:\n   ```\n   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id\n   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key\n   \n   # Security Groups for each region (output from the script)\n   SECURITY_GROUP_US_EAST=sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n   SECURITY_GROUP_US_WEST=sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n   SECURITY_GROUP_EU_CENTRAL=sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n   SECURITY_GROUP_AP_SOUTHEAST=sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n   \n   # Database URL\n   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/npubhealth\n   ```\n\n4. **Set up PostgreSQL database**:\n   Follow these steps to set up the database:\n   - Install PostgreSQL\n   - Create a database named `npubhealth`\n   - Run migrations to create tables:\n     ```\n     npm run db:push\n     ```\n\n5. **Test the integration**:\n   ```\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n\n### Architecture\n\nThe AWS integration consists of:\n\n1. **EC2 Manager** (`server/aws/ec2Manager.ts`): Handles creating and checking EC2 instances.\n2. **Server Monitor** (`server/aws/serverMonitor.ts`): Periodically checks and updates server status.\n3. **API Endpoints** (`server/routes.ts`): Provides REST endpoints for server management.\n4. **Database Integration** (`server/db`): Persists server information and status.\n\n### User Flow\n\n1. User selects a server tier, region, and name\n2. System generates a payment address\n3. User sends payment (simulated in development)\n4. System deploys an EC2 instance with the Blossom server installation script\n5. UI polls for server status until it's running\n6. User connects to their personal Blossom server\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- The security groups allow HTTP, HTTPS, and the Blossom server port (3000)\n- SSH access should be restricted to specific IPs in production\n- AWS credentials should have limited permissions following the principle of least privilege\n- For production, consider using IAM roles instead of credentials\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Check AWS credentials and permissions\n2. Verify that security groups are properly configured\n3. Look at server logs for deployment errors\n4. Check the database for server status information\n\nFor more information about the AWS SDK, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html).

      "readme_content": "# EHR Tools with MCP and FHIR\n![EHR Tools Overview](static/overview.png)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K0t6MRyIqZU?si=Mz4d65DcAD3i2YbO\n\nThis project acts as a specialized server providing tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI agents to interact with Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It leverages the **SMART on FHIR** standard for secure data access and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to expose the tools.\n\nThink of it as a secure gateway and toolkit enabling AI to safely access and analyze patient data from diverse EHR systems.\n\n## The Core Idea\n\nThe system works in three main stages:\n\n1.  **SMART on FHIR Client (Implemented within this project):** Connects securely to an EHR using the standard SMART App Launch framework. It extracts a wide range of patient information, including both structured data (like conditions, medications, labs) and unstructured clinical notes or attachments.\n2.  **MCP Server (This Project):** Takes the extracted EHR data and makes it available through a set of powerful tools accessible via the Model Context Protocol. These tools allow external systems (like AI models) to query and analyze the data without needing direct access to the EHR itself.\n3.  **AI / LLM Interface (External Consumer):** An AI agent or Large Language Model connects to the MCP Server and uses the provided tools to \"ask questions\" about the patient's record, perform searches, or run custom analyses.\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe MCP Server offers several tools for interacting with the loaded EHR data:\n\n*   `grep_record`: Performs text or regular expression searches across *all* parts of the fetched record (structured FHIR data + text from notes/attachments). Ideal for finding keywords or specific mentions (e.g., \"diabetes\", \"aspirin\").\n*   `query_record`: Executes read-only SQL `SELECT` queries directly against the structured FHIR data. Useful for precise lookups based on known FHIR resource structures (e.g., finding specific lab results by LOINC code).\n*   `eval_record`: Executes custom JavaScript code directly on the fetched data (FHIR resources + attachments). Offers maximum flexibility for complex calculations, combining data from multiple sources, or custom formatting.\n\nThis setup allows AI tools to leverage comprehensive EHR data through a standardized and secure interface.\n\n*(Developer setup and usage details can be found within the codebase and specific module documentation.)*\n\n---\n\n## Components & Usage\n\nThis project offers different ways to fetch EHR data and expose it via MCP tools:\n\n### 1. Standalone SMART on FHIR Web Client\n\nThis project includes a self-contained web application that allows users to connect to their EHR via SMART on FHIR and fetch their data.\n\n*   **Hosted Version:** You can use a publicly hosted version at: \\\n    [`https://mcp.fhir.me/ehr-connect#deliver-to-opener:$origin`](https://mcp.fhir.me/ehr-connect#deliver-to-opener:$origin) \\\n    (Replace `$origin` with the actual origin of the window that opens this link).\n*   **Filtering Brands (`?brandTags`):** You can filter the list of EHR providers shown on the connection page by adding the `brandTags` query parameter to the URL. Provide a comma-separated list of tags. Only brands matching *all* provided tags (from their configuration in `brandFiles`) will be displayed.\n    It supports both OR (comma-separated) and AND (caret `^` separated) logic, with AND taking precedence.\n    *   `?brandTags=epic,sandbox`: Shows brands tagged with `epic` OR `sandbox`.\n    *   `?brandTags=epic^dev`: Shows brands tagged with both `epic` AND `dev`.\n    *   `?brandTags=epic^dev,sandbox^prod`: Shows brands tagged with (`epic` AND `dev`) OR (`sandbox` AND `prod`).\n    *   If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to showing brands tagged with `prod`.\n    *   Example: `.../ehr-connect?brandTags=hospital^us`: Shows brands tagged with `hospital` AND `us`.\n*   **How it Works:** When opened, this page prompts the user to select their EHR provider. It then initiates the standard SMART App Launch flow, redirecting the user to their EHR's login page. After successful authentication and authorization, the client fetches a comprehensive set of FHIR resources (Patient, Conditions, Observations, Medications, Documents, etc.) and attempts to extract plaintext from any associated attachments (like PDFs, RTF, HTML found in `DocumentReference`).\n*   **Data Output (`ClientFullEHR`):** Once fetching is complete, the client gathers all the data into a `ClientFullEHR` JSON object. This object contains:\n    *   `fhir`: A dictionary where keys are FHIR resource types (e.g., \"Patient\") and values are arrays of the corresponding FHIR resources.\n    *   `attachments`: An array of processed attachment objects, each including metadata (source resource, path, content type) and the content itself (`contentBase64` for raw data, `contentPlaintext` for extracted text).\n*   **Data Delivery:** If opened with the `#deliver-to-opener:$origin` hash, the client will prompt the user for confirmation and then send the `ClientFullEHR` object back to the window that opened it using `window.opener.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.\n\n### 2. Local MCP Server via Stdio (`src/cli.ts`)\n\nThis mode is ideal for running the MCP server locally, often used with tools like Cursor or other command-line AI clients.\n\n*   **Two-Step Process:**\n    1.  **Fetch Data to Database:** First, run the command-line interface with the `--create-db` and `--db` flags. This starts a temporary web server and uses the same SMART on FHIR web client logic described above to fetch data. Instead of sending the data via `postMessage`, it saves the `ClientFullEHR` data into a local SQLite database file.\n        ```bash\n        # Example: Fetch data and save to data/my_record.sqlite\n        bun run src/cli.ts --create-db --db ./data/my_record.sqlite\n        ```\n        Follow the prompts (opening a link in your browser) to connect to your EHR.\n    2.  **Run MCP Server:** Once the database file is created, run the CLI again, pointing only to the database file. This loads the data into memory and starts the MCP server, listening for commands on standard input/output.\n        ```bash\n        # Example: Start the MCP server using the saved data\n        bun run src/cli.ts --db ./data/my_record.sqlite\n        ```\n    *   **Configuration (`config.*.json`):** This process relies on a configuration file (e.g., `config.epicsandbox.json`) which defines available EHR brands/endpoints in a `brandFiles` array. Each entry in this array specifies the brand's details, including:\n        *   `url`: Path/URL to the brand definition file (like `static/brands/epic-sandbox.json`).\n        *   `tags`: An array of strings (e.g., `[\"epic\", \"sandbox\"]`) used for categorization or filtering.\n        *   `vendorConfig`: Contains SMART on FHIR client details (`clientId`, `scopes`).\n*   **Client Configuration (e.g., Cursor):** Configure your MCP client to execute this command. **Crucially, use absolute paths** for both `src/cli.ts` and the database file.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"local-ehr\": {\n          \"name\": \"Local EHR Search\",\n          \"command\": \"bun\", // Or the absolute path to bun\n          \"args\": [\n              \"/home/user/projects/smart-mcp/src/cli.ts\", // Absolute path to cli.ts\n              \"--db\",\n              \"/home/user/projects/smart-mcp/data/my_record.sqlite\" // Absolute path to DB file\n            ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n### 3. Full MCP Server via SSE (`src/sse.ts` / `index.ts`)\n\nThis mode runs a persistent server suitable for scenarios where multiple clients might connect over the network. It uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for the MCP communication channel.\n\n*   **Authentication:** Client authentication relies on OAuth 2.1, as specified by the Model Context Protocol. The server provides standard endpoints (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/register`, etc.).\n*   **Data Fetch:** When a client initiates an OAuth connection, the server handles the SMART on FHIR flow *itself*, fetches the `ClientFullEHR` data *during* the authorization process, and keeps it in memory (or a persisted session) for the duration of the client's connection.\n*   **Status:** While functional, the MCP specification for OAuth 2.1 client interaction is still evolving. Client support for this authentication method is **extremely limited** at present, making it difficult to test this mode with standard clients outside of specialized developer or debugging tools. This SSE mode should be considered **experimental**.\n",

Now you can add the server to your `mcp_settings.json` file:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n      ...\n      \"statpearls\": {\n        \"command\": \"node\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"{path_to_proj_here}/dist/index.js\"\n        ]\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Tool Definition\n\nThe server provides a single tool:\n\n- **statpearls_disease_info**: Fetches comprehensive, reliable medical information about diseases from StatPearls.\n\n### Input Schema\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"diabetes\",\n  \"format_options\": {\n    \"includeToc\": true,\n    \"maxLength\": 50000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `query`: Disease or medical condition to search for (required)\n- `format_options`: Optional formatting preferences\n  - `includeToc`: Whether to include a table of contents (default: true)\n  - `maxLength`: Maximum length of the returned content in characters (default: 50000)\n\n### Example Output\n\nThe tool returns formatted Markdown content with:\n\n- Title and source information\n- Table of contents (optional)\n- Structured sections including etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis (when available)\n\n## Development\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\nstatpearls-mcp/\n├── src/                         # Source code\n│   ├── index.ts                 # Main entry point and server setup\n│   ├── test-html-parser.ts      # Test utility for HTML parser\n│   ├── test-statpearls-parser.ts # Test utility for StatPearls parser\n│   ├── testrun.ts               # Test runner utility\n│   ├── tools/                   # Tool definitions and handlers\n│   │   └── statpearls.ts        # StatPearls tool definition and handler\n│   ├── services/                # Core functionality services\n│   │   ├── search.ts            # Search functionality\n│   │   ├── content.ts           # Content retrieval and processing\n│   │   └── markdown.ts          # HTML to Markdown conversion\n│   ├── types/                   # Type definitions\n│   │   ├── index.ts             # Common type definitions\n│   │   └── statpearls.ts        # StatPearls-specific type definitions\n│   └── utils/                   # Utility functions\n│       ├── html.ts              # HTML parsing utilities\n│       ├── error.ts             # Error handling utilities\n│       └── statpearls-parser.ts # StatPearls content parsing utilities\n├── scripts/                     # Build and utility scripts\n│   ├── build.ts                 # Build script for creating Node.js compatible bundle\n│   ├── compile.ts               # Script for compiling executables\n│   ├── release.ts               # Script for handling releases\n│   └── version.ts               # Script for managing versioning\n├── dist/                        # Build output directory (not in repository)\n├── package.json                 # Project configuration and dependencies\n├── tsconfig.json                # TypeScript configuration\n├── bun.lock                     # Bun dependency lock file\n├── README.md                    # Main project documentation\n└── RELEASE-PROCESS.md           # Documentation for release process\n```\n\n### Building and Releasing\n\n#### Building\n\nThe build process creates a single JavaScript file that can run with vanilla Node.js:\n\n```bash\n# Production build\nbun run build\n# or\nbun run build:prod\n\n# Development build\nbun run build:dev\n```\n\nThis creates a bundled file at `dist/index.js` that includes all dependencies.\n\n#### Compiling Executables\n\nYou can compile platform-specific executables using Bun's compilation feature:\n\n```bash\n# Compile for all platforms\nbun run compile:all\n\n# Compile for specific platforms\nbun run compile:linux\nbun run compile:windows\nbun run compile:mac\n```\n\nThis creates executable files in the `dist` directory:\n- `statpearls-mcp` (default executable)\n- `statpearls-mcp-linux-x64` (Linux)\n- `statpearls-mcp-windows-x64.exe` (Windows)\n- `statpearls-mcp-darwin-x64` (macOS)\n\n#### Releasing\n\nThe release process handles versioning, building, compiling, and Git operations:\n\n```bash\n# Release a patch version (bug fixes)\nbun run release:patch\n\n# Release a minor version (new features, backward compatible)\nbun run release:minor\n\n# Release a major version (breaking changes)\nbun run release:major\n```\n\nThis process:\n1. Updates the version in package.json\n2. Builds the distribution file\n3. Compiles executables for all platforms\n4. Creates a Git commit with the version number\n5. Creates a Git tag for the version\n6. Pushes the commit and tag to GitHub\n\n#### Versioning\n\nThe project follows semantic versioning. You can check the current version with:\n\n```bash\nbun run version\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n",

This server allows AI assistants to directly query clinical trial data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database.\n\n## Features\n\n### Tools\n\n- `list_tables`\n   - Get an overview of all available tables in the AACT database\n   - Useful for understanding the database structure before analysis\n\n- `describe_table`\n   - Examine the detailed structure of a specific AACT table\n   - Shows column names and data types\n   - Example: `{\"table_name\": \"studies\"}`\n\n- `read_query`\n   - Execute a SELECT query on the AACT clinical trials database\n   - Safely handle SQL queries with validation\n   - Example: `{\"query\": \"SELECT nct_id, brief_title FROM ctgov.studies LIMIT 5\", \"max_rows\": 50}`\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Database Access\n1. Create a free account at https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/users/sign_up\n2. Set environment variables:\n   - `DB_USER`: AACT database username\n   - `DB_PASSWORD`: AACT database password\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nNote that you need Claude Desktop and a Claude subscription at the moment. \n\nAdd one of the following configurations to the file claude_desktop_config.json. (On macOS, the file is located at /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json and you will need to create it yourself if it does not exist yet).\n\n### Option 1: Using the published package\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"CTGOV-MCP\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-server-aact\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DB_USER\": \"USERNAME\",\n        \"DB_PASSWORD\": \"PASSWORD\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Using Docker\n\nSimply add this configuration to claude_desktop_config.json (no build required):\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"CTGOV-MCP-DOCKER\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--env\", \"DB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME\",\n        \"--env\", \"DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD\",\n        \"navisbio/mcp-server-aact:latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Running from source (development)\n\nSimply add this configuration to claude_desktop_config.json (no build required):\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"CTGOV-MCP-DOCKER\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--env\", \"DB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME\",\n        \"--env\", \"DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD\",\n        \"navisbio/mcp-server-aact:latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Example Prompts\n\nHere are some example prompts to use with this plugin:\n\n1. \"What are the most common types of interventions in breast cancer clinical trials?\"\n2. \"How many phase 3 clinical trials were completed in 2023?\"\n3. \"Show me the enrollment statistics for diabetes trials across different countries\"\n4. \"What percentage of oncology trials have reported results in the last 5 years?\"\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### `spawn uvx ENOENT` Error\n\nThis error has been reported when the system cannot find the `uvx` command which might happen when `uvx` is installed in a non-standard location (like `~/.local/bin/`).\n\n**Potential Solution:** Update your configuration with the full path. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n    \"CTGOV-MCP\": {\n      \"command\": \"/Users/username/.local/bin/uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-server-aact\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DB_USER\": \"USERNAME\",\n        \"DB_PASSWORD\": \"PASSWORD\"\n      }\n    }\n}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions!

specific genetic mutations\n   - Provide mutation information as contextual resources\n   - Integrate seamlessly with Claude Desktop\n\n2. **Flow Design** (Collaborative):\n   - User queries Claude Desktop about a genetic mutation\n   - Claude calls our MCP server tool\n   - Server queries clinicaltrials.gov API\n   - Server processes and summarizes the results\n   - Server returns formatted results to Claude\n\n3. **Utilities** (Collaborative):\n   - `clinicaltrials/query.py`: Handles API calls to clinicaltrials.gov\n   - `utils/call_llm.py`: Utilities for working with Claude\n\n4. **Node Design** (AI-led):\n   - `utils/node.py`: Implements base Node and BatchNode classes with prep/exec/post pattern\n   - `clinicaltrials/nodes.py`: Defines specialized nodes for querying and summarizing\n   - `clinicaltrials_mcp_server.py`: Orchestrates the flow execution\n\n5. **Implementation** (AI-led):\n   - FastMCP SDK for handling the protocol details\n   - Error handling at all levels\n   - Resources for common mutations\n\n## Architecture Components\n\n### Unified MCP Server (`servers/main.py`)\n\nThe main unified server implementing the Model Context Protocol with **runtime mode selection**:\n\n- **Unified Architecture**: Single implementation supporting both sync and async modes\n- **Runtime Mode Selection**: Automatic detection via event loop or explicit `MCP_ASYNC_MODE` configuration\n- **Enterprise Tools**: Health monitoring, metrics collection, cache management (mode-dependent)\n- **Auto-scaling**: Circuit breakers and retry logic for robust API communication\n- **Cache Warming**: Automatically pre-loads common mutations for instant responses (async mode)\n- **API Resilience**: Handles 403 Forbidden errors with unified HTTP client fallback mechanisms\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy servers redirect with deprecation warnings\n\n### Unified Service Layer\n\n**Clinical Trials Service** (`clinicaltrials/service.py`): Unified API client with mode-aware processing\n- **Dual Mode Support**: Same interface for both sync (`query_trials`) and async (`aquery_trials`) calls\n- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Automatic failure detection and recovery\n- **Distributed Caching**: Redis-backed caching with in-memory fallback\n- **Metrics Collection**: Detailed performance and usage analytics\n- **API Compatibility**: Uses unified HTTP client for reliable clinicaltrials.gov API access\n\n**LLM Service** (`utils/llm_service.py`): Unified LLM interaction client\n- **Mode-Aware Processing**: Supports both sync and async LLM calls\n- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured logging\n\n### Unified Nodes (`clinicaltrials/unified_nodes.py`)\n\nPocketFlow nodes with **automatic sync/async execution**:\n- **QueryTrialsNode**: Unified node with mode detection for API requests\n- **SummarizeTrialsNode**: Unified LLM-powered summarization with retry logic\n- **BatchQueryTrialsNode**: Batch processing with concurrency control (async) or sequential processing (sync)\n- **Auto-Detection**: Nodes automatically determine execution mode at runtime\n\n### Unified Foundation Layer\n\n- **Unified HTTP Client** (`utils/http_client.py`): Single HTTP client supporting both sync and async with connection pooling\n- **Unified Node Framework** (`utils/unified_node.py`): Base classes with automatic mode detection\n- **Shared Utilities** (`utils/shared.py`): Common validation, error handling, and metrics functions\n- **Cache Strategies** (`utils/cache_strategies.py`): Smart cache warming and invalidation (async mode)\n- **Configuration System** (`servers/config.py`): Centralized configuration with environment overrides\n- **Legacy Compatibility** (`servers/legacy_compat.py`): Backward compatibility layer with migration guidance\n\n## Unified Node Pattern Implementation\n\nThis project implements the **enhanced PocketFlow Node pattern** with unified sync/async execution, providing a modular, maintainable approach to building AI workflows:\n\n### Unified Core Node Classes (`utils/unified_node.py`)\n\n- **UnifiedNode**: Base class supporting both sync and async execution with automatic mode detection\n- **UnifiedBatchNode**: Extension for batch processing with concurrency control (async) or sequential processing (sync)\n- **UnifiedFlow**: Orchestrates execution with intelligent mode selection\n\n### Unified Implementation Nodes (`clinicaltrials/unified_nodes.py`)\n\n1. **QueryTrialsNode** (Unified):\n   ```python\n   # Single implementation supporting both modes\n   def prep(self, shared): return shared[\"mutation\"]\n   \n   def exec(self, mutation): \n       return self.trials_service.query_trials(mutation)  # Sync version\n   \n   async def aexec(self, mutation): \n       return await self.trials_service.aquery_trials(mutation)  # Async version\n   \n   def post(self, shared, mutation, result):\n       shared[\"trials_data\"] = result\n       shared[\"studies\"] = result.get(\"studies\", [])\n       return self.get_next_node_id(result)\n   ```\n\n2. **SummarizeTrialsNode** (Unified):\n   ```python\n   # Unified summarization with mode detection\n   def prep(self, shared): return shared[\"studies\"]\n   \n   def exec(self, studies): \n       return self.llm_service.call_llm(prompt)  # Sync version\n   \n   async def aexec(self, studies): \n       return await self.llm_service.acall_llm(prompt)  # Async version\n   \n   def post(self, shared, studies, summary):\n       shared[\"summary\"] = summary\n       return None  # End of flow\n   ```\n\n### Unified Flow Execution\n\nThe unified MCP server creates and runs flows with automatic mode detection:\n\n```python\n# Create unified nodes (mode determined at runtime)\nquery_node = QueryTrialsNode(async_mode=server.async_mode)\nsummarize_node = SummarizeTrialsNode(async_mode=server.async_mode)\n\n# Use PocketFlow chaining syntax\nquery_node >> summarize_node\n\n# Create unified flow\nflow = UnifiedFlow(start_node=query_node, async_mode=server.async_mode)\n\n# Run flow with shared context (automatically sync or async)\nshared = {\"mutation\": mutation}\nif server.async_mode:\n    result = await flow.aexecute(shared)\nelse:\n    result = flow.execute(shared)\n```\n\n### Key Advantages of Unified Pattern\n\n✅ **Single Implementation**: One codebase supports both sync and async execution  \n✅ **Auto-Detection**: Nodes automatically determine optimal execution mode  \n✅ **Runtime Selection**: Mode can be selected at server startup or runtime  \n✅ **Preserved Interface**: Same `prep`, `exec`, `post` pattern maintained  \n✅ **Performance Optimization**: Mode-specific optimizations (timeouts, concurrency, batch limits)  \n✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy node patterns continue working with deprecation warnings  \n\nThis unified pattern eliminates code duplication while preserving the modular, testable nature of the original PocketFlow design.

Use path placeholders in your configuration, and substitute them with your actual paths:\n\n### Recommended Configuration (Unified Server)\n\n```json\n\"mutation-clinical-trials-mcp\": {\n  \"command\": \"{PATH_TO_VENV}/bin/python\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"{PATH_TO_PROJECT}/servers/main.py\"\n  ],\n  \"description\": \"Unified clinical trials matching server with automatic mode selection.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Legacy Compatibility (Still Supported)\n\n```json\n\"mutation-clinical-trials-mcp-legacy\": {\n  \"command\": \"{PATH_TO_VENV}/bin/python\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"{PATH_TO_PROJECT}/servers/primary.py\"\n  ],\n  \"description\": \"Legacy async server (redirects to unified server with deprecation warnings).\"\n}\n```\n\n**Path Variables:**\n- `{PATH_TO_VENV}`: Full path to your virtual environment directory.\n- `{PATH_TO_PROJECT}`: Full path to the directory containing your project files.\n\n**Installation Instructions:**\n1. Clone the repository to your local machine.\n2. Install uv if you don't have it already:\n   ```bash\n   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh    # macOS/Linux\n   # or\n   iwr -useb https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex    # Windows PowerShell\n   ```\n3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies in one step:\n   ```bash\n   uv sync\n   ```\n4. Activate the virtual environment when needed:\n   ```bash\n   source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux\n   .venv\\Scripts\\activate       # Windows\n   ```\n5. Determine the full path to your virtual environment and project directory.\n6. Update your configuration with these specific paths.\n\n**Examples:**\n- On macOS/Linux:\n  ```json\n  \"command\": \"/Users/username/projects/mutation_trial_matcher/.venv/bin/python\"\n  ```\n- On Windows:\n  ```json\n  \"command\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\projects\\\\mutation_trial_matcher\\\\.venv\\\\Scripts\\\\python.exe\"\n  ```\n\n**Path Finding Tips:**\n- To find the exact path to your Python interpreter in the virtual environment, run:\n  - `which python` (macOS/Linux)\n  - `where python` (Windows, after activating the venv)\n- For the project path, use the full path to the directory containing `servers/primary.py`.\n\n---\n\n## Future Improvements\n\nFor a comprehensive list of planned enhancements and future work, please see the [future_work.md](docs/future_work.md) document.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis project relies on the following key dependencies:\n\n- **Python 3.11+** - Base runtime environment (lowered from 3.13+ for broader compatibility)\n- **FastMCP** (`fastmcp>=2.10.2`) - High-performance async MCP framework\n- **PocketFlow** (`pocketflow>=0.0.1`) - Framework for building modular AI workflows with the Node pattern  \n- **Requests** (`requests==2.31.0`) - HTTP library for clinicaltrials.gov API calls (dev dependency for legacy test compatibility)\n- **HTTPX** (`httpx>=0.28.1`) - Async HTTP client for direct Anthropic API calls\n- **Redis** (`redis>=6.2.0`) - Optional distributed caching backend\n- **Python-dotenv** (`python-dotenv==1.1.0`) - Environment variable management\n\n**Enterprise Features:**\n- Prometheus metrics collection and monitoring\n- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance\n- Distributed caching with Redis backend\n- Cache warming strategies for performance optimization\n\nAll dependencies can be installed using `uv sync` as described in the installation instructions.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf Claude Desktop disconnects from the MCP server:\n- Check logs at: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mutation-clinical-trials-mcp.log`\n- Restart Claude Desktop  \n- Verify the server is running correctly with `uv run python servers/main.py`\n- Check for deprecation warnings if using legacy servers (`servers/primary.py` or `servers/legacy/sync_server.py`)\n\n**Redis Connection Warnings:**\n- Redis connection errors are expected if Redis is not installed - the server uses in-memory caching as fallback\n- To eliminate warnings: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`\n- The server works perfectly without Redis, just with reduced caching performance\n\n**Cache Warming on Startup:**\n- Server automatically queries 15 common mutations on startup for performance optimization\n- This is normal behavior and improves response times for frequent queries\n- To disable: comment out `asyncio.run(startup_tasks())` in `servers/primary.py`\n\n## Development History\n\nThis project evolved through multiple phases of AI-collaborative development:\n\n**Phase 1** (2024-04-30): Initial prototype using synchronous architecture  \n**Phase 2** (2024-12): Enhanced with comprehensive testing and documentation  \n**Phase 3** (2025-01): Major refactoring for improved organization and maintainability  \n**Phase 4** (2025-01): Full async migration with enterprise features and 80% performance improvement  \n**Phase 5** (2025-07): API resilience improvements and 403 error resolution  \n**Phase 6** (2025-07): **Code Deduplication Project** - Comprehensive 4-phase unification effort  \n**Phase 7** (2025-07): **Repository Quality Excellence** - Professional code standards and legacy cleanup\n\n### Recent Achievements (July 2025)\n\n**Code Deduplication Project**:  \n**Phase 1**: Foundation Layer - Unified HTTP client and shared utilities  \n**Phase 2**: Service Layer Consolidation - Unified LLM and Clinical Trials services  \n**Phase 3**: Node Layer Unification - Enhanced UnifiedNode framework  \n**Phase 4**: Server Consolidation - Complete unified architecture  \n\n**Repository Quality Excellence**:  \n- **Code Quality**: 99.6% improvement (1,695 of 1,702 linting errors fixed)  \n- **Type Safety**: 69% reduction in type diagnostics (48 → 15)  \n- **Professional Cleanup**: 3,435 lines of deprecated code removed  \n- **Compatibility Layer**: Complete backward compatibility with `utils/node.py` compatibility module  \n- **Python Compatibility**: Lowered requirement from Python 3.13+ to 3.11+ for broader adoption\n\n**Results**: 60% code reduction (~1,000 lines eliminated), zero breaking changes, unified sync/async architecture, production-ready code quality\n\n**Current Version (v0.2.1)**: Production-ready unified server with enterprise features, automatic mode selection, professional type safety, and comprehensive backward compatibility.

It exposes Strava data and functionalities as \"tools\" that Large Language Models (LLMs) can utilize through the MCP standard.\n\n<a href=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@r-huijts/strava-mcp\">\n  <img width=\"380\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@r-huijts/strava-mcp/badge\" alt=\"Strava Server MCP server\" />\n</a>\n\n## Features\n\n- 🏃 Access recent activities, profile, and stats.\n- 📊 Fetch detailed activity streams (power, heart rate, cadence, etc.).\n- 🗺️ Explore, view, star, and manage segments.\n- ⏱️ View detailed activity and segment effort information.\n- 📍 List and view details of saved routes.\n- 💾 Export routes in GPX or TCX format to the local filesystem.\n- 🤖 AI-friendly JSON responses via MCP.\n- 🔧 Uses Strava API V3.\n\n## Natural Language Interaction Examples\n\nAsk your AI assistant questions like these to interact with your Strava data:\n\n**Recent Activity & Profile:**\n* \"Show me my recent Strava activities.\"\n* \"What were my last 3 rides?\"\n* \"Get my Strava profile information.\"\n* \"What's my Strava username?\"\n\n**Activity Streams & Data:**\n* \"Get the heart rate data from my morning run yesterday.\"\n* \"Show me the power data from my last ride.\"\n* \"What was my cadence profile for my weekend century ride?\"\n* \"Get all stream data for my Thursday evening workout.\"\n* \"Show me the elevation profile for my Mt. Diablo climb.\"\n\n**Stats:**\n* \"What are my running stats for this year on Strava?\"\n* \"How far have I cycled in total?\"\n* \"Show me my all-time swim totals.\"\n\n**Specific Activities:**\n* \"Give me the details for my last run.\"\n* \"What was the average power for my interval training on Tuesday?\"\n* \"Did I use my Trek bike for my commute yesterday?\"\n\n**Clubs:**\n* \"What Strava clubs am I in?\"\n* \"List the clubs I've joined.\"\n\n**Segments:**\n* \"List the segments I starred near Boulder, Colorado.\"\n* \"Show my favorite segments.\"\n* \"Get details for the 'Alpe du Zwift' segment.\"\n* \"Are there any good running segments near Golden Gate Park?\"\n* \"Find challenging climbs near Boulders Flagstaff Mountain.\"\n* \"Star the 'Flagstaff Road Climb' segment for me.\"\n* \"Unstar the 'Lefthand Canyon' segment.\"\n\n**Segment Efforts:**\n* \"Show my efforts on the 'Sunshine Canyon' segment this month.\"\n* \"List my attempts on Box Hill between January and June this year.\"\n* \"Get the details for my personal record on Alpe d'Huez.\"\n\n**Routes:**\n* \"List my saved Strava routes.\"\n* \"Show the second page of my routes.\"\n* \"What is the elevation gain for my Boulder Loop route?\"\n* \"Get the description for my 'Boulder Loop' route.\"\n* \"Export my 'Boulder Loop' route as a GPX file.\"\n* \"Save my Sunday morning route as a TCX file.\"\n\n## Advanced Prompt Example\n\nHere's an example of a more advanced prompt to create a professional cycling coach analysis of your Strava activities:\n\n```\nYou are Tom Verhaegen, elite cycling coach and mentor to world champion Mathieu van der Poel. Analyze my most recent Strava activity. Provide a thorough, data-driven assessment of the ride, combining both quantitative insights and textual interpretation.\n\nBegin your report with a written summary that highlights key findings and context. Then, bring the raw numbers to life: build an interactive, visually striking dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use bold, high-contrast colors and intuitive, insightful chart types that best suit each metric (e.g., heart rate, power, cadence, elevation).\n\nEmbed clear coaching feedback and personalized training recommendations directly within the visualization. These should be practical, actionable, and grounded solely in the data provided—no assumptions or fabrications.\n\nAs a bonus, sprinkle in motivational quotes and cheeky commentary from Mathieu van der Poel himself—he's been watching my rides with one eyebrow raised and a smirk of both concern and amusement.\n\nGoal: Deliver a professional-grade performance analysis that looks and feels like it came straight from the inner circle of world-class cycling.\n```\n\nThis prompt creates a personalized analysis of your most recent Strava activity, complete with professional coaching feedback and a custom visualization dashboard.\n\n## ⚠️ Important Setup Sequence\n\nFor successful integration with Claude, follow these steps in exact order:\n\n1. Install the server and its dependencies\n2. Configure the server in Claude's configuration\n3. Complete the Strava authentication flow\n4. Restart Claude to ensure proper environment variable loading\n\nSkipping steps or performing them out of order may result in environment variables not being properly read by Claude.\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Node.js (v18 or later recommended)\n   - npm (usually comes with Node.js)\n   - A Strava Account\n\n### 1. From Source\n\n1. **Clone Repository:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/r-huijts/strava-mcp.git\n   cd strava-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n3. **Build the Project:**\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n### 2. Configure Claude Desktop\n\nUpdate your Claude configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"strava-mcp-local\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/absolute/path/to/your/strava-mcp/dist/server.js\"\n      ]\n      // Environment variables are read from the .env file by the server\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `/absolute/path/to/your/strava-mcp/` with the actual path to your installation.\n\n### 3. Strava Authentication Setup\n\nThe `setup-auth.ts` script makes it easy to set up authentication with the Strava API. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n#### Create a Strava API Application\n\n1. Go to [https://www.strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)\n2. Create a new application:\n   - Enter your application details (name, website, description)\n   - Important: Set \"Authorization Callback Domain\" to `localhost`\n   - Note down your Client ID and Client Secret\n\n#### Run the Setup Script\n\n```bash\n# In your strava-mcp directory\nnpx tsx scripts/setup-auth.ts\n```\n\nFollow the prompts to complete the authentication flow (detailed instructions in the Authentication section below).\n\n### 4. Restart Claude\n\nAfter completing all the above steps, restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect. This ensures that:\n- The new configuration is loaded\n- The environment variables are properly read\n- The Strava MCP server is properly initialized\n\n## 🔑 Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| STRAVA_CLIENT_ID | Your Strava Application Client ID (required) |\n| STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET | Your Strava Application Client Secret (required) |\n| STRAVA_ACCESS_TOKEN | Your Strava API access token (generated during setup) |\n| STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN | Your Strava API refresh token (generated during setup) |\n| ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH | Absolute path for saving exported route files (optional) |\n\n## Token Handling\n\nThis server implements automatic token refreshing. When the initial access token expires (typically after 6 hours), the server will automatically use the refresh token stored in `.env` to obtain a new access token and refresh token. These new tokens are then updated in both the running process and the `.env` file, ensuring continuous operation.\n\nYou only need to run the `scripts/setup-auth.ts` script once for the initial setup.\n\n## Configure Export Path (Optional)\n\nIf you intend to use the `export-route-gpx` or `export-route-tcx` tools, you need to specify a directory for saving exported files.\n\nEdit your `.env` file and add/update the `ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH` variable:\n```dotenv\n# Optional: Define an *absolute* path for saving exported route files (GPX/TCX)\n# Ensure this directory exists and the server process has write permissions.\n# Example: ROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=/Users/your_username/strava-exports\nROUTE_EXPORT_PATH=\n```\n\nReplace the placeholder with the **absolute path** to your desired export directory. Ensure the directory exists and the server has permission to write to it.\n\n## API Reference\n\nThe server exposes the following MCP tools:\n\n---\n\n### `get-recent-activities`\n\nFetches the authenticated user's recent activities.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks about their recent workouts, activities, runs, rides, etc.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `perPage` (optional):\n    - Type: `number`\n    - Description: Number of activities to retrieve.\n    - Default: 30\n- **Output:** Formatted text list of recent activities (Name, ID, Distance, Date).\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `get-athlete-profile`\n\nFetches the profile information for the authenticated athlete.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks for their profile details, username, location, weight, premium status, etc.\n- **Parameters:** None\n- **Output:** Formatted text string with profile details.\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `get-athlete-stats`\n\nFetches activity statistics (recent, YTD, all-time) for the authenticated athlete.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks for their overall statistics, totals for runs/rides/swims, personal records (longest ride, biggest climb).\n- **Parameters:** None\n- **Output:** Formatted text summary of stats, respecting user's measurement preference.\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `get-activity-details`\n\nFetches detailed information about a specific activity using its ID.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks for details about a *specific* activity identified by its ID.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `activityId` (required):\n    - Type: `number`\n    - Description: The unique identifier of the activity.\n- **Output:** Formatted text string with detailed activity information (type, date, distance, time, speed, HR, power, gear, etc.), respecting user's measurement preference.\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Invalid `activityId`, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `list-athlete-clubs`\n\nLists the clubs the authenticated athlete is a member of.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks about the clubs they have joined.\n- **Parameters:** None\n- **Output:** Formatted text list of clubs (Name, ID, Sport, Members, Location).\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `list-starred-segments`\n\nLists the segments starred by the authenticated athlete.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks about their starred or favorite segments.\n- **Parameters:** None\n- **Output:** Formatted text list of starred segments (Name, ID, Type, Distance, Grade, Location).\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `get-segment`\n\nFetches detailed information about a specific segment using its ID.\n\n- **When to use:** When the user asks for details about a *specific* segment identified by its ID.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `segmentId` (required):\n    - Type: `number`\n    - Description: The unique identifier of the segment.\n- **Output:** Formatted text string with detailed segment information (distance, grade, elevation, location, stars, efforts, etc.), respecting user's measurement preference.\n- **Errors:** Missing/invalid token, Invalid `segmentId`, Strava API errors.\n\n---\n\n### `explore-segments`\n\nSearches for popular segments within a given geographical area (bounding box).\n\n- **When to use:** When the user wants to find or discover segments in a specific geographic area, optionally filtering by activity type or climb category.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `bounds` (required):\n    - Type: `string`\n    - Description: Comma-separated: `south_west_lat,south_west_lng,north_east_lat,north_east_lng`.\n  - `activityType` (optional):\n    - Type: `string` (`\"running\"` or `\"riding\"`)\n    - Description: Filter by activity type.\n  - `minCat` (optional):\n    - Type: `number` (0-5)\n    - Description: Minimum climb category.

Once installed, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:\n\nThis will start the FastMCP server, making the following medical calculation tools available for MCP clients:\n\n*   `egfr_epi`: Calculates eGFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation.\n*   `egfr_epi_cr_cys`: Calculates eGFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C equation.\n*   `bp_children`: Calculates pediatric blood pressure percentiles.\n*   `bmi_bsa_calculator`: Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA).\n*   `crcl_cockcroft_gault`: Calculates Creatinine Clearance using Cockcroft-Gault.\n*   `map_calculator`: Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).\n*   `chads2_vasc_score`: Calculates CHA₂DS₂-VASc score for stroke risk.\n*   `prevent_cvd_risk`: Predicts 10-year risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT).\n*   `corrected_calcium`: Calculates corrected calcium for albumin levels.\n*   `qtc_calculator`: Calculates Corrected QT Interval (QTc) using various formulas.\n*   `wells_pe_criteria`: Calculates Wells' Criteria score for Pulmonary Embolism risk.\n*   `ibw_abw_calculator`: Calculates Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW).\n*   `pregnancy_calculator`: Calculates pregnancy due dates.\n*   `revised_cardiac_risk_index`: Calculates RCRI for pre-operative cardiac risk.\n*   `child_pugh_score`: Calculates Child-Pugh score for cirrhosis.\n*   `steroid_conversion`: Converts corticosteroid dosages.\n*   `calculate_mme`: Calculates Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME).\n*   `maintenance_fluids`: Calculates maintenance IV fluid rate (4-2-1 Rule).\n*   `corrected_sodium`: Calculates corrected sodium for hyperglycemia.\n*   `meld_3`: Calculates MELD 3.0 score for liver disease.\n*   `framingham_risk_score`: Calculates Framingham Risk Score for 10-year CHD risk.\n*   `homa_ir`: Calculates HOMA-IR score for insulin resistance.\n\n## Claude Desktop / `uvx` Integration\n\nThis server can be integrated with applications like Claude Desktop that support MCP. To configure Claude Desktop (or another FastAgent application) to use this server, you can add an entry to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.\n\nAssuming you have `uvx` installed and configured, you can typically run an installed Python package command via `uvx`. Here's an example configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"medcalc\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"medcalc@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Ensure `uvx` is installed (`pip install uvx`) and the `medcalc` package is installed in an environment accessible by `uvx`. The exact `uvx` command might vary based on your specific `uvx` setup and environment management.\n",

Code that is in the master branch has passed code reviews and automated tests, but it may not be deemed ready for production. This branch usually contains the most recent changes and features being worked on by the development team. It's often the starting point for creating feature branches (where new features are developed) and hotfix branches (for urgent fixes).\n\nEach package is tagged with beta version numbers, and published to npm such as `@ohif/ui@3.6.0-beta.1`\n\n### `release/*` branches - The latest stable releases\nOnce the `master` branch code reaches a stable, release-ready state, we conduct a comprehensive code review and QA testing. Upon approval, we create a new release branch from `master`. These branches represent the latest stable version considered ready for production.\n\nFor example, `release/3.5` is the branch for version 3.5.0, and `release/3.6` is for version 3.6.0. After each release, we wait a few days to ensure no critical bugs. If any are found, we fix them in the release branch and create a new release with a minor version bump, e.g., 3.5.1 in the `release/3.5` branch.\n\nEach package is tagged with version numbers and published to npm, such as `@ohif/ui@3.5.0`. Note that `master` is always ahead of the `release` branch. We publish docker builds for both beta and stable releases.\n\nHere is a schematic representation of our development workflow:\n\n![alt text](platform/docs/docs/assets/img/github-readme-branches-Jun2024.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Yarn 1.17.3+](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)\n- [Node 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n- Yarn Workspaces should be enabled on your machine:\n  - `yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`\n\n### Getting Started\n\n1.

Install the required dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install httpx fastmcp pydantic\n```\n\n5. Ensure the data directories are created (the script will do this automatically on first run):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p data/users data/logs\n```\n\n## Running the MCP Server\n\nRun the server using:\n\n```bash\npython food_tracker.py\n```\n\nThe server will start and be ready to receive commands.\n\n## Using with Claude\n\nTo use this MCP with Claude, you'll need to register it with the Claude platform. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Follow Anthropic's documentation to register your MCP:\n   - Visit https://console.anthropic.com/mcps or the relevant section in your Anthropic account\n   - Register the food-tracker MCP by providing the necessary information and endpoint\n\n2. Once registered, you can interact with the Food Tracker through Claude by invoking the MCP's tools.\n\nExample prompts to use with Claude:\n\n- \"Scan this barcode to see nutrition information: 3270190119357\"\n- \"Add a peanut allergy to my dietary restrictions\"\n- \"Log that I had a granola bar for breakfast\"\n- \"Search for products containing 'oatmeal'\"\n- \"Check if this product is compatible with my dietary restrictions\"\n- \"Show me my food log for today\"\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThis MCP provides the following tools that Claude can access:\n\n### 1. `get_product_by_barcode`\n\nGet detailed information about a food product using its barcode.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `barcode`: The product barcode (EAN, UPC, etc.)\n\n### 2. `search_products`\n\nSearch for food products by name or description.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `query`: The search query\n- `page`: Page number for pagination (default: 1)\n- `page_size`: Number of results per page (default: 10)\n\n### 3. `manage_user_restrictions`\n\nManage a user's dietary restrictions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `user_id`: The user's unique identifier\n- `action`: The action to perform (get, add, remove, update)\n- `restriction_type`: Type of restriction (allergen, diet, ingredient, medical, preference)\n- `restriction_value`: The specific restriction value (e.g., \"peanuts\", \"vegetarian\")\n- `severity`: How severe the restriction is (avoid, limit, fatal)\n- `notes`: Additional notes about the restriction\n\n### 4. `check_product_compatibility`\n\nCheck if a product is compatible with a user's dietary restrictions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `user_id`: The user's unique identifier\n- `barcode`: The product barcode to check\n\n### 5. `analyze_nutrition`\n\nAnalyze the nutritional content of a food product.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `barcode`: The product barcode\n\n### 6. `log_food_consumption`\n\nLog food consumption for a user.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `user_id`: The user's unique identifier\n- `barcode`: The product barcode\n- `quantity`: Amount consumed (default: 1 serving)\n- `meal_type`: Type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)\n\n### 7. `get_user_food_log`\n\nGet a user's food log for a specific date.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `user_id`: The user's unique identifier\n- `date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format (defaults to today)\n\n## Example Usage Scenarios\n\n### Setting Up a New User with Restrictions\n\n1. Add a gluten allergy:\n```\nmanage_user_restrictions(\n    user_id=\"user123\",\n    action=\"add\",\n    restriction_type=\"allergen\", \n    restriction_value=\"gluten\",\n    severity=\"avoid\",\n    notes=\"Avoid all wheat products\"\n)\n```\n\n2. Add a vegetarian diet:\n```\nmanage_user_restrictions(\n    user_id=\"user123\",\n    action=\"add\",\n    restriction_type=\"diet\", \n    restriction_value=\"vegetarian\"\n)\n```\n\n### Tracking Food Consumption\n\n1. Scan a product and log it:\n```\n# First get product info\nproduct = get_product_by_barcode(barcode=\"3270190119357\")\n\n# Then log consumption\nlog_food_consumption(\n    user_id=\"user123\",\n    barcode=\"3270190119357\",\n    quantity=1,\n    meal_type=\"breakfast\"\n)\n```\n\n2. Check compatibility with restrictions:\n```\ncheck_product_compatibility(\n    user_id=\"user123\",\n    barcode=\"3270190119357\"\n)\n```\n\n### Analyzing Nutritional Information\n\n1. Get detailed nutrition analysis:\n```\nanalyze_nutrition(barcode=\"3270190119357\")\n```\n\n2. View food log and nutrition totals:\n```\nget_user_food_log(user_id=\"user123\")\n```\n\n## Data Storage\n\nThe Food Tracker MCP stores data locally in JSON files:\n\n- User profiles: `./data/users/{user_id}.json`\n- Food logs: `./data/logs/{user_id}_{date}.json`\n\n## Extending the MCP\n\nYou can extend the MCP by:\n\n1. Adding new nutritional analysis features\n2. Implementing more detailed diet plans and goals\n3. Adding recipe suggestions based on available ingredients\n4. Creating reports and visualizations of nutrition data\n5. Implementing social features for sharing progress\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If you encounter connection issues, ensure you have internet access as the MCP connects to the OpenFoodFacts API\n- If product information is incomplete, this may be due to limitations in the OpenFoodFacts database\n- For any data persistence issues, check the permissions on the data directory\n",
