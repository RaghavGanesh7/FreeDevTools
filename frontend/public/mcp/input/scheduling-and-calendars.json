Suggest some time slots.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Install\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install G Suite Integration for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@alBERT-launcher/mcp-gsuite):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @alBERT-launcher/mcp-gsuite --client claude\n```\n\n#### Oauth 2\n\nGoogle Workspace (G Suite) APIs require OAuth2 authorization. Follow these steps to set up authentication:\n\n1. Create OAuth2 Credentials:\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Create a new project or select an existing one\n   - Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API for your project\n   - Go to \"Credentials\" → \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Select \"Desktop app\" or \"Web application\" as the application type\n   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with required information\n   - Add authorized redirect URIs (include `http://localhost:4100/code` for local development)\n\n2. Required OAuth2 Scopes:\n   \n\n```json\n   [\n     \"openid\",\n     \"https://mail.google.com/\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email\"\n   ]\n```\n\n3. Then create a `.gauth.json` in your working directory with client\n\n```json\n{\n    \"web\": {\n        \"client_id\": \"$your_client_id\",\n        \"client_secret\": \"$your_client_secret\",\n        \"redirect_uris\": [\"http://localhost:4100/code\"],\n        \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n        \"token_uri\": \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. Create a `.accounts.json` file with account information\n\n```json\n{\n    \"accounts\": [\n        {\n            \"email\": \"alice@bob.com\",\n            \"account_type\": \"personal\",\n            \"extra_info\": \"Additional info that you want to tell Claude: E.g. 'Contains Family Calendar'\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can specifiy multiple accounts. Make sure they have access in your Google Auth app. The `extra_info` field is especially interesting as you can add info here that you want to tell the AI about the account (e.g. whether it has a specific agenda)\n\nNote: When you first execute one of the tools for a specific account, a browser will open, redirect you to Google and ask for your credentials, scope, etc. After a successful login, it stores the credentials in a local file called `.oauth.{email}.json` . Once you are authorized, the refresh token will be used.\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-gsuite\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"<dir_to>/mcp-gsuite\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"mcp-gsuite\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Published Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-gsuite\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-gsuite\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nThe MCP server can be configured with several command-line options to specify custom paths for authentication and account information:\n\n* `--gauth-file`: Specifies the path to the `.gauth.json` file containing OAuth2 client configuration. Default is `./.gauth.json`.\n* `--accounts-file`: Specifies the path to the `.accounts.json` file containing information about the Google accounts. Default is `./.accounts.json`.\n* `--credentials-dir`: Specifies the directory where OAuth credentials are stored after successful authentication. Default is the current working directory with a subdirectory for each account as `.oauth.{email}.json`.\n\nThese options allow for flexibility in managing different environments or multiple sets of credentials and accounts, especially useful in development and testing scenarios.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```bash\nuv run mcp-gsuite --gauth-file /path/to/custom/.gauth.json --accounts-file /path/to/custom/.accounts.json --credentials-dir /path/to/custom/credentials\n```\n\nThis configuration is particularly useful when you have multiple instances of the server running with different configurations or when deploying to environments where the default paths are not suitable.\n\n## Development\n\n### Building and Publishing\n\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\n\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n2. Build package distributions:\n\n```bash\nuv build\n```\n\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\n\n3. Publish to PyPI:\n\n```bash\nuv publish\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\n* Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\n* Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [ `npm` ](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-gsuite run mcp-gsuite\n```\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\nYou can also watch the server logs with this command:\n\n```bash\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-gsuite.log\n```\n",

Interactive (Delegated)\nThank you [Lokka](https://lokka.dev/)\n\nBest for: User-impersonation scenarios, accessing user-specific data\n- Prompts user to login interactively\n- Uses delegated permissions\n- Authenticates as the signed-in user\n\n#### 2. Client Credentials (App-Only)\nBest for: Server-to-server scenarios, automated processes\n- Uses Azure AD application credentials\n- Requires Application permissions\n- Works without user interaction\n\n#### 3. Client Provided Token\nBest for: Custom token management, pre-acquired tokens\n- Uses a token provided by the client\n- Requires managing token refresh externally\n\n### Microsoft Graph API Setup\n\n#### For Interactive (Delegated) Mode\n1. Register an application in the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (or use an existing app)\n2. Add a redirect URI: `http://localhost` (Mobile and desktop applications platform)\n3. **Enable public client flows**: Go to Authentication > Advanced settings > \"Allow public client flows\" = **YES**\n4. Grant necessary **Delegated permissions**: Microsoft Graph API > Delegated permissions > Calendars.ReadWrite, People.Read, User.Read\n5. Note your Client ID and Tenant ID (Client Secret not needed for interactive mode with custom app)\n\n> **Note:** The server uses a built-in multi-tenant app by default, so custom app setup is optional. When authentication is needed, the device code and login URL will appear directly in your MCP client chat interface.\n\n#### For Client Credentials (App-Only) Mode\n1. Register an application in the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)\n2. Create a client secret\n3. Grant necessary **Application permissions**: Microsoft Graph API > Application permissions > Calendars.ReadWrite, People.Read.All, User.ReadBasic.All\n4. Grant admin consent for your organization\n5. Note your Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID\n\n### Usage with VS Code\n\n#### Authentication Mode Configuration\n\nThe MCP server supports different authentication modes via the `AUTH_MODE` environment variable:\n- `interactive` (default) - User authentication with browser or device code flow  \n- `client_credentials` - App-only authentication with client secret\n- `client_provided_token` - Use a pre-acquired token\n\n**Backward Compatibility**: If `AUTH_MODE` is not specified, the server automatically detects the mode:\n- Presence of `CLIENT_SECRET` → `client_credentials` mode\n- Presence of `ACCESS_TOKEN` → `client_provided_token` mode  \n- Neither present → `interactive` mode (default)\n\n#### Local Node.js\n\nYou can run the MCP server directly with Node.js from your local build:\n\n1. Clone the repository and build the project:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/anoopt/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server.git\ncd outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n2. For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing Preferences: `Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others:\n\n**Interactive Mode (Default - Zero Configuration):**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook-meetings-scheduler\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Interactive Mode with Custom App:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook-meetings-scheduler\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"AUTH_MODE\": \"interactive\",\n        \"CLIENT_ID\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\",\n        \"TENANT_ID\": \"<YOUR_TENANT_ID>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Client Credentials Mode:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook-meetings-scheduler\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"AUTH_MODE\": \"client_credentials\",\n        \"CLIENT_ID\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\",\n        \"CLIENT_SECRET\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>\",\n        \"TENANT_ID\": \"<YOUR_TENANT_ID>\",\n        \"USER_EMAIL\": \"<YOUR_EMAIL>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Client Provided Token Mode:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook-meetings-scheduler\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"AUTH_MODE\": \"client_provided_token\",\n        \"ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>\",\n        \"TOKEN_EXPIRES_ON\": \"2025-10-03T12:00:00Z\",\n        \"USER_EMAIL\": \"<YOUR_EMAIL>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note:** \n> - Uses a built-in multi-tenant Azure AD app (works for any organization)\n> - USER_EMAIL is automatically determined from the signed-in user\n> - Users will see a one-time consent prompt (no admin approval needed)\n> - Zero configuration required - works out of the box\n\n**Interactive Mode with Custom App:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook-meetings-scheduler\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"AUTH_MODE\": \"interactive\",\n        \"CLIENT_ID\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\",\n        \"TENANT_ID\": \"<YOUR_TENANT_ID>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Use a custom app if you need specific branding or tenant restrictions.\n\nReplace `/path/to/outlook-meetings-scheduler-mcp-server` with the absolute path to your cloned repository.\n\n#### Docker\n\nRun the MCP server using Docker locally. Build the Docker image with the following command: \n\n``` bash\ndocker build -t mcp/outlook-meetings-scheduler .\n```\n\nFor manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing Preferences: `Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace.

Next steps\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n### Interactive Mode (Default)\n\n| Variable | Description | Required | Default |\n|----------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| `AUTH_MODE` | Authentication mode | No | `interactive` |\n| `CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD Application (Client) ID | No | Built-in multi-tenant app |\n| `TENANT_ID` | Azure AD Tenant ID | No | `common` (multi-tenant) |\n| `USER_EMAIL` | Email address of the user | No | Auto-detected from signed-in user |\n| `REDIRECT_URI` | Custom redirect URI | No | `http://localhost` |\n\n### Client Credentials Mode\n\n| Variable | Description | Required |\n|----------|-------------|----------|\n| `AUTH_MODE` | Authentication mode | Yes |\n| `CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD Application (Client) ID | Yes |\n| `CLIENT_SECRET` | Azure AD Application Client Secret | Yes |\n| `TENANT_ID` | Azure AD Tenant ID | Yes |\n| `USER_EMAIL` | Email address of the user whose calendar to access | Yes |\n\n### Client Provided Token Mode\n\n| Variable | Description | Required | Default |\n|----------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| `AUTH_MODE` | Authentication mode | Yes | - |\n| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | Pre-acquired access token | Yes | - |\n| `USER_EMAIL` | Email address of the user | Yes | - |\n| `TOKEN_EXPIRES_ON` | Token expiration date (ISO format) | No | 1 hour from start time |\n\n#### How to Obtain an Access Token\n\nYou can obtain an access token through several methods:\n\n**1. Azure CLI (For Microsoft Graph - Recommended for testing):**\n```bash\n# Login to Azure\naz login\n\n# Get token specifically for Microsoft Graph with correct scopes\naz account get-access-token --resource=https://graph.microsoft.com --query accessToken --output tsv\n```\n\n> **Note:** The Azure CLI token has broad permissions but may not include specific calendar scopes (Calendars.ReadWrite). For production use, consider methods 3 or 4 below with explicit scope configuration.\n\n**2. PowerShell REST API (Recommended for Windows):**\n```powershell\n# For client credentials flow (app-only) - most reliable method\n$clientId = \"your-client-id\"\n$clientSecret = \"your-client-secret\" \n$tenantId = \"your-tenant-id\"\n\n$body = @{\n    grant_type = \"client_credentials\"\n    client_id = $clientId\n    client_secret = $clientSecret\n    scope = \"https://graph.microsoft.com/.default\"\n}\n\n$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token\" -Method Post -Body $body\n$token = $response.access_token\nWrite-Host \"Access Token: $token\"\n```\n\n**3. From Your Own Application (Most Reliable):**\n```javascript\n// Using @azure/identity with specific scopes\nimport { ClientSecretCredential } from '@azure/identity';\n\nconst credential = new ClientSecretCredential(\n  'your-tenant-id',\n  'your-client-id', \n  'your-client-secret'\n);\n\n// Request token with specific Microsoft Graph scopes\nconst token = await credential.getToken([\n  'https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite',\n  'https://graph.microsoft.com/People.Read', \n  'https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read'\n]);\n\n// Use token.token as your ACCESS_TOKEN\nconsole.log(token.token);\n```\n\n**4. Using OAuth2 Device Code Flow (Interactive):**\n```bash\n# For personal Microsoft accounts or when you need user consent\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/devicecode \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -d 'client_id={your-client-id}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite https://graph.microsoft.com/People.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read'\n\n# Follow the device code instructions, then exchange for token\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -d 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&client_id={your-client-id}&device_code={device-code-from-step-1}'\n```\n\n**5. Client Credentials Flow (App-Only):**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client-id}&client_secret={client-secret}&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default'\n```\n\n**Important:** Ensure your Azure AD app registration has the required **delegated** or **application** permissions:\n- **Delegated**: Calendars.ReadWrite, People.Read, User.Read  \n- **Application**: Calendars.ReadWrite, People.Read.All, User.ReadBasic.All (requires admin consent)\n\n### Authentication Mode Details\n\n#### client_credentials\n- **Best for:** Automated scenarios, server-to-server communication\n- **Requires:** `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `TENANT_ID`, `USER_EMAIL`\n- **Permissions:** Application permissions (e.g., Calendars.ReadWrite)\n- **Note:** Requires admin consent for the application\n\n#### interactive (Default)\n- **Best for:** User-impersonation scenarios, delegated access (most common use case)\n- **Setup:** Zero configuration required - works out of the box\n- **Requires:** Nothing (uses built-in multi-tenant app)\n- **Optional:** `CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID` for custom app\n- **Permissions:** Delegated permissions (e.g., Calendars.ReadWrite)\n- **Authentication Flow:** \n  - Attempts browser-based interactive login first\n  - Falls back to device code flow if browser auth fails\n  - **Device code and URL appear in MCP client chat** for easy access\n  - User will be prompted to authenticate in their browser\n- **Note:** Uses built-in multi-tenant app (works for any organization)\n\n#### client_provided_token\n- **Best for:** Custom token management, integration with existing auth systems\n- **Requires:** `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `USER_EMAIL`\n- **Optional:** `TOKEN_EXPIRES_ON` (if not provided, assumes 1-hour validity from start time)\n- **Token Sources:** Microsoft Graph PowerShell, custom applications, OAuth2 flows, Azure CLI (with limitations)\n- **Use Cases:** Testing with specific scopes, integration with existing auth flows, CI/CD pipelines, development/debugging\n- **Note:** Token refresh must be handled externally\n\n## Build\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build the project\nnpm run build\n\n# Docker build\ndocker build -t mcp/outlook-meetings-scheduler .\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the ISC License.

Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/bastienchabal/gmail-mcp.git\n   cd gmail-mcp\n   ```\n\n2. Set up a virtual environment using uv:\n   ```bash\n   pip install uv\n   uv venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n3. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   uv pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration\n\n### Step 1: Authenticate with Google\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one\n3. Enable Google APIs:\n   - [Enable the Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)\n   - [Enable the Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)\n4. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent):\n   - Select \"External\" user type\n   - Add your email as a test user\n   - Add all the [scopes](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/scopes) of Gmail and Calendar\n5. Create [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):\n   - Choose \"Desktop app\" as the application type\n   - Download the JSON credentials file and copy the Client ID and Client Secret\n\n### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop\n\n1. Create or edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Claude`\n2. Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"gmail-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/.venv/bin/mcp\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/gmail_mcp/main.py:mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"cwd\": \"/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"PYTHONPATH\": \"/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp\",\n        \"CONFIG_FILE_PATH\": \"/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/config.yaml\",\n        \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\": \"<your-client-id>\",\n        \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\": \"<your-client-secret>\",\n        \"TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY\": \"<generate-a-random-key>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotes:\n- Replace `<absolute-path>` with the actual path to your gmail-mcp directory\n- Replace `<your-client-id>` and `<your-client-secret>` with your Google OAuth credentials (previously generated in the json file)\n- Optional : Generate a random encryption key with: `python -c \"import os; from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())\"`\n\nThe configuration is designed to keep sensitive data (client ID, client secret, and encryption key) in the Claude Desktop configuration file, while non-sensitive settings are stored in the config.yaml file included in the repository.\n\n### Step 3: Use Claude Desktop\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Type a prompt like: \"Please retrieve my last email\"\n3. Claude should automatically connect to the MCP server and ask you to authenticate to your Gmail account (creating the file tokens.json)\n\n## ❓ Troubleshooting\n\n### Important Note on MCP\n\nIf Claude Desktop doesn't connect automatically (i.e. you do not see the tool icon underneath the prompt input), you can try:\n- Restarting Claude Desktop\n- Asking Claude to \"Use the Gmail MCP server\"\n- Login to Gmail manually using one of these methods:\n\n### Important Note on Authentication\n\n1. **Authentication Problems**:\n   - Run `python debug/auth_test.py` to test the authentication process with detailed feedback\n   - Check that the token file exists at the project root\n   - Verify that your Google Cloud Console project has the correct redirect URI configured\n   - Make sure all required scopes are added to your OAuth consent screen\n   - If you see \"Scope has changed\" errors, ensure that the `openid` scope is included in your OAuth consent screen\n   - If you see \"redirect_uri_mismatch\" errors, add the exact URI shown in the error message to your authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console\n   - If the callback page doesn't load or process properly, check if port 8000 is already in use by another application\n\n2. **Calendar API Issues**:\n   - Make sure you've enabled the Calendar API in Google Cloud Console\n   - Check that you've granted all the necessary scopes during authentication\n   - Run `python debug/reauth_calendar.py` to re-authenticate with Calendar API scopes\n   - Verify that `CALENDAR_API_ENABLED` is set to `true` in your environment variables\n\n### Important Note on Calendar Integration\n\nCalendar integration can be turned off in the configuration file. If you've previously authenticated with the Gmail MCP server and are now enabling Calendar integration, you'll need to re-authenticate to grant the additional Calendar API scopes. You can do this by:\n\n1. Deleting the existing tokens.json file (if present, either at projet root or in  ~/Users/`<username/>`gmail_mcp_tokens/tokens.json)\n2. Restarting the MCP server\n3.

      "readme_content": "# google-calendars-mcp-server-by-cdata\nCData's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Google Calendars\n\n:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project builds a read-only MCP server. For full read, write, update, delete, and action capabilities and a simplified setup, check out our free [CData MCP Server for Google Calendars (beta)](https://www.cdata.com/download/download.aspx?sku=EGZM-V&type=beta). \n## Purpose\nWe created this read-only MCP Server to allow LLMs (like Claude Desktop) to query live data Google Calendars supported by the [CData JDBC Driver for Google Calendars](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/googlecalendar/jdbc).\n\nCData JDBC Driver connects to Google Calendars by exposing them as relational SQL models.\n\nThis server wraps that driver and makes Google Calendars data available through a simple MCP interface, so LLMs can retrieve live information by asking natural language questions — no SQL required.\n\n## Setup Guide\n1. Clone the repository:\n      ```bash\n      git clone https://github.com/cdatasoftware/google-calendars-mcp-server-by-cdata.git\n      cd google-calendars-mcp-server-by-cdata\n      ```\n2. Build the server:\n      ```bash\n      mvn clean install\n      ``` \n      This creates the JAR file: CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n2. Download and install the CData JDBC Driver for {source}: [https://www.cdata.com/drivers/googlecalendar/download/jdbc](https://www.cdata.com/drivers/googlecalendar/download/jdbc)\n3. License the CData JDBC Driver:\n    * Navigate to the `lib` folder in the installation directory, typically:\n        * (Windows) `C:\\Program Files\\CData\\CData JDBC Driver for Google Calendars\\`\n        * (Mac/Linux) `/Applications/CData JDBC Driver for Google Calendars/`\n    * Run the command `java -jar cdata.jdbc.googlecalendar.jar --license`\n    * Enter your name, email, and \"TRIAL\" (or your license key).\n4. Configure your connection to the data source (Salesforce as an example):\n    * Run the command `java -jar cdata.jdbc.googlecalendar.jar` to open the Connection String utility.\n      \n      <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5b5237b-79c1-472c-8c2f-3f9eb1ac9627\" title=\"CData JDBC Driver Connectiong String utility.\" width=384px />\n    * Configure the connection string and click \"Test Connection\"\n      > **Note:** If the data sources uses OAuth, you will need to authenticate in your browser.\n    * Once successful, copy the connection string for use later.\n5. Create a `.prp` file for your JDBC connection (e.g. `google-calendars.prp`) using the following properties and format:\n    * **Prefix** - a prefix to be used for the tools exposed\n    * **ServerName** - a name for your server\n    * **ServerVersion** - a version for your server\n    * **DriverPath** - the full path to the JAR file for your JDBC driver\n    * **DriverClass** - the name of the JDBC Driver Class (e.g. cdata.jdbc.googlecalendar.GoogleCalendarDriver)\n    * **JdbcUrl** - the JDBC connection string to use with the CData JDBC Driver to connect to your data (copied from above)\n    * **Tables** - leave blank to access all data, otherwise you can explicitly declare the tables you wish to create access for\n      ```env\n      Prefix=googlecalendar\n      ServerName=CDataGoogleCalendar\n      ServerVersion=1.0\n      DriverPath=PATH\\TO\\cdata.jdbc.googlecalendar.jar\n      DriverClass=cdata.jdbc.googlecalendar.GoogleCalendarDriver\n      JdbcUrl=jdbc:googlecalendar:InitiateOAuth=GETANDREFRESH;\n      Tables=\n      ```\n\n## Using the Server with Claude Desktop\n1. Create the config file for Claude Desktop ( claude_desktop_config.json) to add the new MCP server, using the format below. If the file already exists, add the entry to the `mcpServers` in the config file.\n\n      **Windows**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"{classname_dash}\": {\n            \"command\": \"PATH\\\\TO\\\\java.exe\",\n            \"args\": [\n              \"-jar\",\n              \"PATH\\\\TO\\\\CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar\",\n              \"PATH\\\\TO\\\\google-calendars.prp\"\n            ]\n          },\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n      \n      **Linux/Mac**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"{classname_dash}\": {\n            \"command\": \"/PATH/TO/java\",\n            \"args\": [\n              \"-jar\",\n              \"/PATH/TO/CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar\",\n              \"/PATH/TO/google-calendars.prp\"\n            ]\n          },\n          ...\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n      If needed, copy the config file to the appropriate directory (Claude Desktop as the example).\n      **Windows**\n      ```bash\n      cp C:\\PATH\\TO\\claude_desktop_config.json %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n      ```\n      **Linux/Mac**\n      ```bash\n      cp /PATH/TO/claude_desktop_config.json /Users/{user}/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json'\n      ```\n2. Run or refresh your client (Claude Desktop).\n   \n> **Note:** You may need to fully exit or quit your Claude Desktop client and re-open it for the MCP Servers to appear.\n\n## Running the Server\n1. Run the follow the command to run the MCP Server on its own\n      ```bash\n      java -jar /PATH/TO/CDataMCP-jar-with-dependencies.jar /PATH/TO/Salesforce.prp\n> **Note:** The server uses `stdio` so can only be used with clients that run on the same machine as the server.\n## Usage Details\nOnce the MCP Server is configured, the AI client will be able to use the built-in tools to read, write, update, and delete the underlying data. In general, you do not need to call the tools explicitly. Simply ask the client to answer questions about the underlying data system. For example:\n* \"What is the correlation between my closed won opportunities and the account industry?\"\n* \"How many open tickets do I have in the SUPPORT project?\"\n* \"Can you tell me what calendar events I have today?\"\n\nThe list of tools available and their descriptions follow:\n### Tools & Descriptions\nIn the definitions below, `{servername}` refers to the name of the MCP Server in the config file (e.g. `{classname_dash}` above).\n* `{servername}_get_tables` - Retrieves a list of tables available in the data source. Use the `{servername}_get_columns` tool to list available columns on a table. The output of the tool will be returned in CSV format, with the first line containing column headers.\n* `{servername}_get_columns` - Retrieves a list of columns for a table. Use the `{servername}_get_tables` tool to get a list of available tables. The output of the tool will be returned in CSV format, with the first line containing column headers.\n* `{servername}_run_query` - Execute a SQL SELECT query\n\n## JSON-RPC Request Examples\nIf you are scripting out the requests sent to the MCP Server instead of using an AI Client (e.g. Claude), then you can refer to the JSON payload examples below – following the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification - when calling the available tools. \n\n#### google_calendars_get_tables\n```json\n{\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n    \"params\": {\n        \"name\": \"google_calendars_get_tables\",\n        \"arguments\": {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### google_calendars_get_columns\n```json\n{\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n    \"params\": {\n        \"name\": \"google_calendars_get_columns\",\n        \"arguments\": {\n            \"table\":  \"Account\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### google_calendars_run_query\n```json\n{\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n    \"params\": {\n        \"name\": \"google_calendars_run_query\",\n        \"arguments\": {\n            \"sql\":  \"SELECT * FROM [Account] WHERE [IsDeleted] = true\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n1. If you cannot see your CData MCP Server in Claude Desktop, be sure that you have fully quit Claude Desktop (Windows: use the Task Manager, Mac: use the Activity Monitor)\n2. If Claude Desktop is unable to retrieve data, be sure that you have configured your connection properly. Use the Connection String builder to create the connection string (see above) and copy the connection string into the property (.prp) file.\n3. If you are having trouble connecting to your data source, contact the [CData Support Team](https://www.cdata.com/support/submit.aspx).\n4. If you are having trouble using the MCP server, or have any other feedback, join the [CData Community](https://community.cdata.com).\n\n## License\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.

      "readme_content": "# Google Calendar MCP Server (Python)\n\nThis project implements a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as an interface between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Google Calendar API. It enables LLMs to perform calendar operations via natural language requests.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Authentication:** Secure Google Calendar API access using OAuth 2.0 (Desktop App Flow with automatic token storage/refresh).\n*   **Core Calendar Actions:**\n    *   List calendars (`mcp_google_calendar_list_calendars`).\n    *   Create calendars (`mcp_google_calendar_create_calendar`).\n    *   Find events with basic and advanced filtering (`mcp_google_calendar_find_events`).\n    *   Create detailed events (`mcp_google_calendar_create_event`).\n    *   Quick-add events from text (`mcp_google_calendar_quick_add_event`).\n    *   Update events (`mcp_google_calendar_update_event`).\n    *   Delete events (`mcp_google_calendar_delete_event`).\n    *   Add attendees to events (`mcp_google_calendar_add_attendee`).\n*   **Advanced Scheduling & Analysis:**\n    *   Check attendee response status (`mcp_google_calendar_check_attendee_status`).\n    *   Query free/busy information for multiple calendars (`mcp_google_calendar_query_free_busy`).\n    *   Find mutual free slots and schedule meetings automatically (`mcp_google_calendar_schedule_mutual`).\n    *   Analyze daily event counts and durations (`mcp_google_calendar_analyze_busyness`).\n    *   *(Recurring event projection feature potentially added in Task 3.5, but not explicitly exposed as a tool yet)*\n*   **Server:** FastAPI-based server exposing actions via a RESTful API.\n*   **MCP Integration:** Provides MCP-compatible tools via stdio using the `mcp_sdk` library.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:**\n    *   Python 3.8+ installed.\n    *   Git installed.\n    *   Access to a Google Cloud Platform project.\n\n2.  **Clone Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url> # Replace with your repo URL\n    cd <repository-directory>\n    ```\n\n3.  **Google Cloud Setup (OAuth Credentials):**\n    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.\n    *   **Enable the Google Calendar API** for your project.\n    *   Navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\".\n    *   Click \"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\" > \"OAuth client ID\".\n    *   Select **Application type: Desktop app**. Give it a name (e.g., \"Calendar MCP Local\").\n    *   Click \"CREATE\". A pop-up will show your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. **Copy these now** - you'll need them for the `.env` file. You *do not* need to download the JSON file offered for other app types.\n    *   Configure the **OAuth consent screen**:\n        *   Set User Type to \"External\".\n        *   Fill in required app info (App name, User support email, Developer contact).\n        *   Add Scopes: Click \"Add or Remove Scopes\", search for `calendar`, add the `.../auth/calendar` scope (read/write access). Click \"Update\".\n        *   Add Test Users: Add the Google Account email address(es) you will authenticate with.\n        *   Save and return to the dashboard.\n    *   Go back to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\" and click on the name of the Desktop App credential you created.\n    *   Under \"Authorized redirect URIs\", click \"+ ADD URI\" and enter `http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback`. Click \"Save\". (Adjust the port if you change `OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` in `.env`).\n\n4.  **Environment Configuration (`.env` file):**\n    *   In the project's root directory, copy the `env.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.\n    *   Open the `.env` file and paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from Google Cloud:\n        ```dotenv\n        # Google OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials (from Google Cloud Console - Desktop app type)\n        GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE'\n        GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'\n\n        # Path to the file where the user's OAuth tokens will be stored after first auth\n        # This file is created automatically. Default is .gcp-saved-tokens.json\n        TOKEN_FILE_PATH='.gcp-saved-tokens.json'\n\n        # Port for the local webserver during the OAuth callback (must match Google Cloud redirect URI)\n        OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT=8080\n\n        # Google Calendar API Scopes (read/write is default)\n        # Use 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly' for read-only access\n        CALENDAR_SCOPES='https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'\n        ```\n    *   Ensure `TOKEN_FILE_PATH` points to a location where the app can write the token file (the default `.gcp-saved-tokens.json` in the root is usually fine). This file is automatically added to `.gitignore`.\n\n5.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    *   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.\n    *   Install the required Python packages:\n        ```bash\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n        ```\n    *   *(Using a Python virtual environment is recommended but optional)*\n\n## Running the Server (for Initial Authentication & Testing)\n\nYou only need to run the server manually **once** to complete the initial Google OAuth authentication flow. After that, your MCP client will launch the server automatically using the command specified in its configuration.\n\n1.  **First Run (Authentication):**\n    *   Run the server script from your terminal:\n        ```bash\n        python run_server.py\n        ```\n    *   The script checks for saved tokens (`.gcp-saved-tokens.json`). Since they don't exist yet, it will:\n        *   Print an authorization URL.\n        *   Automatically open your browser to that URL.\n        *   Guide you through logging into your Google Account and granting calendar permissions.\n        *   After you grant permissions, Google redirects back to a local URL (`http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback`).\n        *   The script captures the authorization code and **saves the necessary tokens** to the file specified in `.env` (`.gcp-saved-tokens.json`).\n    *   Once tokens are saved, the script will typically start the FastAPI server (e.g., on `http://localhost:8000`). You can usually stop it (Ctrl+C) after you see confirmation that tokens were saved or the server has started.\n\n2.  **Optional: Testing the Server Directly:**\n    *   If you want to test the FastAPI server directly (e.g., by sending HTTP requests with tools like `curl` or Postman), you can run `python run_server.py` again. It will load the saved tokens and start the server without requiring browser authentication.\n\n**Note:** For regular use with an MCP client, you **do not** need to run `python run_server.py` manually after the initial authentication. The client handles launching it.\n\n## MCP Client Configuration (Example for Cursor/Claude Desktop)\n\nTo use this server as a tool within an MCP client, you need to configure the client to run the `run_server.py` script. This is typically done in a JSON settings file.\n\n**Example `mcp.json` Entry:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tools\": {\n    \"google_calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"C:/path/to/your/calendar-mcp/run_server.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Configuration Details:**\n\n*   **`google_calendar`:** A unique name you choose for this tool instance within your MCP client.\n*   **`command`:** Set this to `python` if it's in your system's PATH. If not, provide the *full absolute path* to the `python.exe` or `python` executable (e.g., `/path/to/your/venv/bin/python` or `C:/path/to/your/venv/Scripts/python.exe`).\n*   **`args`:** Provide the *full, absolute path* to the `run_server.py` script in your project directory. **Replace the placeholder `/path/to/your/calendar-mcp/run_server.py` with the actual path on your system.**\n*   **(Optional) `api`:** Some clients might still need the `api` field to point to the underlying FastAPI server (e.g., `\"api\": \"http://localhost:8000\"`) for schema discovery, even though communication happens via stdio.\n*   **(Optional) `timeout`:** You can add a timeout (e.g., `\"timeout\": 30000` for 30 seconds).\n\n**How it Works:** When the MCP client invokes this tool, it executes the specified `command` with the `args`. The `run_server.py` script detects it's being run this way (via piped stdin/stdout) and automatically starts the MCP communication bridge instead of just the HTTP server.\n\n**Important:**\n*   Your Google Client ID/Secret remain secure in your project's `.env` file, *not* in the MCP client configuration.\n*   Consult your specific MCP client's documentation for the exact configuration file location and required fields.\n\n## Development\n\n*   **Code Structure:**\n    *   `run_server.py`: Main entry point, handles server startup and MCP detection.\n    *   `src/server.py`: FastAPI application definition, HTTP endpoints.\n    *   `src/calendar_actions.py`: Core logic interacting with the Google Calendar API.\n    *   `src/analysis.py`: Advanced analysis functions.\n    *   `src/auth.py`: Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and token management.\n    *   `src/models.py`: Pydantic models for request/response data structures.\n    *   `src/mcp_bridge.py`: Implements the MCP tool definitions using `mcp_sdk`, delegating to the FastAPI server.\n*   **Logging:** Logs are written to `calendar_mcp.log` in the project root.\n*   **Testing:** (Details TBD)\n*   **Contributing:** (Details TBD)\n\n## Next Steps (Planned Tasks)\n\n*   Implement MCP Resources/Prompts support (Task 6.1, 6.2).\n*   Enhance MCP tool argument validation and response formatting (Task 6.3, 6.4).\n*   Improve MCP error handling (Task 6.5).\n*   Refine development workflow (Task 7).\n\n## License\n\nThis project is dual-licensed to support both open-source collaboration and sustainable development:\n\n1.  **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0):**\n    *   This software is free to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the AGPLv3 license. \n    *   Key conditions include that derivative works (including modifications used over a network) must also be licensed under AGPLv3 and their source code made available.\n    *   This license is suitable for open-source projects or internal use where AGPLv3 compliance is feasible.\n    *   See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full text.\n\n2.  **Commercial License:**\n    *   If the terms of the AGPLv3 are not suitable for your specific use case (e.g., integrating this software into a proprietary, closed-source commercial product or service without complying with AGPLv3's source-sharing requirements), a separate commercial license is available.\n    *   Please contact **deciduusleaf@gmail.com** for inquiries regarding commercial licensing options.\n\nBy using, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to be bound by the terms of either the AGPLv3 or a separately negotiated commercial license.

Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials:\n\n   a. Create a Google Cloud Project:\n      - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n      - Create a new project or select an existing one\n      - Enable the Google Calendar API for your project\n\n   b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:\n      - Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n      - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"OAuth client ID\"\n      - Choose either \"Desktop app\" or \"Web application\" as application type\n      - Give it a name and click \"Create\"\n      - For Web application, add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to the authorized redirect URIs\n      - Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys\n      - Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json`\n\n2. Run Authentication:\n\n   You can authenticate in two ways:\n\n   a. Global Authentication (Recommended):\n   ```bash\n   # First time: Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your home directory's .calendar-mcp folder\n   mkdir -p ~/.calendar-mcp\n   mv gcp-oauth.keys.json ~/.calendar-mcp/\n\n   # Run authentication from anywhere\n   npx @gongrzhe/server-calendar-autoauth-mcp auth\n   ```\n\n   b. Local Authentication:\n   ```bash\n   # Place gcp-oauth.keys.json in your current directory\n   # The file will be automatically copied to global config\n   npx @gongrzhe/server-calendar-autoauth-mcp auth\n   ```\n\n   The authentication process will:\n   - Look for `gcp-oauth.keys.json` in the current directory or `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - If found in current directory, copy it to `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - Open your default browser for Google authentication\n   - Save credentials as `~/.calendar-mcp/credentials.json`\n\n   > **Note**: \n   > - After successful authentication, credentials are stored globally in `~/.calendar-mcp/` and can be used from any directory\n   > - Both Desktop app and Web application credentials are supported\n   > - For Web application credentials, make sure to add `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback` to your authorized redirect URIs\n\n3. Configure in Claude Desktop:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@gongrzhe/server-calendar-autoauth-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Docker Support\n\nIf you prefer using Docker:\n\n1. Authentication:\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json,target=/gcp-oauth.keys.json \\\n  -v mcp-calendar:/calendar-server \\\n  -e CALENDAR_OAUTH_PATH=/gcp-oauth.keys.json \\\n  -e \"CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/calendar-server/credentials.json\" \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  mcp/calendar auth\n```\n\n2. Usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-v\",\n        \"mcp-calendar:/calendar-server\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/calendar-server/credentials.json\",\n        \"mcp/calendar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe server provides several tools that can be used through the Claude Desktop:\n\n### Create Event\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Team Meeting\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T10:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"end\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T11:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Weekly team sync\",\n  \"location\": \"Conference Room A\"\n}\n```\n\n### List Events\n```json\n{\n  \"timeMin\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"timeMax\": \"2024-12-31T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"maxResults\": 10,\n  \"orderBy\": \"startTime\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update Event\n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"event123\",\n  \"summary\": \"Updated Meeting Title\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T11:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"end\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Delete Event\n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"event123\"\n}\n```\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- OAuth credentials are stored securely in your local environment (`~/.calendar-mcp/`)\n- The server uses offline access to maintain persistent authentication\n- Never share or commit your credentials to version control\n- Regularly review and revoke unused access in your Google Account settings\n- Credentials are stored globally but are only accessible by the current user\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. **OAuth Keys Not Found**\n   - Make sure `gcp-oauth.keys.json` is in either your current directory or `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - Check file permissions\n\n2. **Invalid Credentials Format**\n   - Ensure your OAuth keys file contains either `web` or `installed` credentials\n   - For web applications, verify the redirect URI is correctly configured\n\n3. **Port Already in Use**\n   - If port 3000 is already in use, please free it up before running authentication\n   - You can find and stop the process using that port\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Suggest some time slots\"\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js >= 18\n- A Google Cloud project with Gmail and Calendar APIs enabled\n- OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google APIs\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/j3k0/mcp-google-workspace.git\n   cd mcp-google-workspace\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Build the TypeScript code:\n   ```bash\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### OAuth 2.0 Setup\n\nGoogle Workspace (G Suite) APIs require OAuth2 authorization. Follow these steps to set up authentication:\n\n1. Create OAuth2 Credentials:\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Create a new project or select an existing one\n   - Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API for your project\n   - Go to \"Credentials\" → \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Select \"Desktop app\" or \"Web application\" as the application type\n   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with required information\n   - Add authorized redirect URIs (include `http://localhost:4100/code` for local development)\n\n2. Required OAuth2 Scopes:\n   ```json\n   [\n     \"openid\",\n     \"https://mail.google.com/\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email\"\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. Create a `.gauth.json` file in the project root with your Google OAuth 2.0 credentials:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"installed\": {\n       \"client_id\": \"your_client_id\",\n       \"project_id\": \"your_project_id\",\n       \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n       \"token_uri\": \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\",\n       \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n       \"client_secret\": \"your_client_secret\",\n       \"redirect_uris\": [\"http://localhost:4100/code\"]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Create a `.accounts.json` file to specify which Google accounts can use the server:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"accounts\": [\n       {\n         \"email\": \"your.email@gmail.com\",\n         \"account_type\": \"personal\",\n         \"extra_info\": \"Primary account with Family Calendar\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   You can specify multiple accounts. Make sure they have access in your Google Auth app. The `extra_info` field is especially useful as you can add information here that you want to tell the AI about the account (e.g., whether it has a specific calendar).\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nConfigure Claude Desktop to use the mcp-google-workspace server:\n\nOn MacOS: Edit `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nOn Windows: Edit `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-google-workspace\": {\n      \"command\": \"<dir_to>/mcp-google-workspace/launch\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Published Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-google-workspace\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-google-workspace\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n## Usage\n\n1.

If omitted, defaults to the server's local timezone.\n*   **Output:** A JSON object containing:\n    *   `timezone` (string): The effective timezone used.\n    *   `datetime` (string): The current time in ISO 8601 format with offset (e.g., `2025-04-26T01:39:15Z`).\n\n### `convert_time`\n\nConverts a time from a source timezone to a target timezone.\n\n*   **Input Arguments:**\n    *   `source_timezone` (string, optional): Source IANA timezone name. Defaults to server's local timezone if omitted.\n    *   `time` (string, required): The time to convert in 24-hour HH:MM format (e.g., `14:30`).\n    *   `target_timezone` (string, optional): Target IANA timezone name. Defaults to server's local timezone if omitted.\n*   **Output:** A JSON object containing:\n    *   `source` (object): Details of the time in the source timezone (`timezone`, `datetime`).\n    *   `target` (object): Details of the converted time in the target timezone (`timezone`, `datetime`).\n    *   `time_difference` (string): The difference between the target and source timezone offsets (e.g., `+8h`, `-5h`, `+5.75h`). \n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

Follow these steps to set up authentication:\n\n1. Create OAuth2 Credentials:\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n   - Create a new project or select an existing one\n   - Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API for your project\n   - Go to \"Credentials\" → \"Create Credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Select \"Desktop app\" or \"Web application\" as the application type\n   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with required information\n   - Add authorized redirect URIs (include `http://localhost:4100/code` for local development)\n\n2. Required OAuth2 Scopes:\n   \n\n```json\n   [\n     \"openid\",\n     \"https://mail.google.com/\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\",\n     \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email\"\n   ]\n```\n\n3. Then create a `.gauth.json` in your working directory with client\n\n```json\n{\n    \"web\": {\n        \"client_id\": \"$your_client_id\",\n        \"client_secret\": \"$your_client_secret\",\n        \"redirect_uris\": [\"http://localhost:4100/code\"],\n        \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n        \"token_uri\": \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. Create a `.accounts.json` file with account information\n\n```json\n{\n    \"accounts\": [\n        {\n            \"email\": \"alice@bob.com\",\n            \"account_type\": \"personal\",\n            \"extra_info\": \"Additional info that you want to tell Claude: E.g. 'Contains Family Calendar'\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can specifiy multiple accounts. Make sure they have access in your Google Auth app. The `extra_info` field is especially interesting as you can add info here that you want to tell the AI about the account (e.g. whether it has a specific agenda)\n\nNote: When you first execute one of the tools for a specific account, a browser will open, redirect you to Google and ask for your credentials, scope, etc. After a successful login, it stores the credentials in a local file called `.oauth.{email}.json` . Once you are authorized, the refresh token will be used.\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Development/Unpublished Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-gsuite\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"<dir_to>/mcp-gsuite\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"mcp-gsuite\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nNote: You can also use the `uv run mcp-gsuite --accounts-file /path/to/custom/.accounts.json` to specify a different accounts file or `--credentials-dir /path/to/custom/credentials` to specify a different credentials directory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-gsuite\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"<dir_to>/mcp-gsuite\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"mcp-gsuite\",\n        \"--accounts-file\",\n        \"/path/to/custom/.accounts.json\",\n        \"--credentials-dir\",\n        \"/path/to/custom/credentials\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Published Servers Configuration</summary>\n  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-gsuite\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp-gsuite\",\n        \"--accounts-file\",\n        \"/path/to/custom/.accounts.json\",\n        \"--credentials-dir\",\n        \"/path/to/custom/credentials\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Configuration Options\n\nThe MCP server can be configured with several command-line options to specify custom paths for authentication and account information:\n\n* `--gauth-file`: Specifies the path to the `.gauth.json` file containing OAuth2 client configuration. Default is `./.gauth.json`.\n* `--accounts-file`: Specifies the path to the `.accounts.json` file containing information about the Google accounts. Default is `./.accounts.json`.\n* `--credentials-dir`: Specifies the directory where OAuth credentials are stored after successful authentication. Default is the current working directory with a subdirectory for each account as `.oauth.{email}.json`.\n\nThese options allow for flexibility in managing different environments or multiple sets of credentials and accounts, especially useful in development and testing scenarios.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```bash\nuv run mcp-gsuite --gauth-file /path/to/custom/.gauth.json --accounts-file /path/to/custom/.accounts.json --credentials-dir /path/to/custom/credentials\n```\n\nThis configuration is particularly useful when you have multiple instances of the server running with different configurations or when deploying to environments where the default paths are not suitable.\n\n## Development\n\n### Building and Publishing\n\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\n\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n2. Build package distributions:\n\n```bash\nuv build\n```\n\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\n\n3. Publish to PyPI:\n\n```bash\nuv publish\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\n* Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\n* Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [ `npm` ](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-gsuite run mcp-gsuite\n```\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\nYou can also watch the server logs with this command:\n\n```bash\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-gsuite.log\n```\n",

Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:\n   ```bash\n   vim ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n   ```\n\n2. Add the Meeting BaaS configuration:\n   ```json\n   \"meetingbaas\": {\n     \"command\": \"/bin/bash\",\n     \"args\": [\n       \"-c\",\n       \"cd /path/to/meeting-mcp && (npm run build 1>&2) && export MCP_FROM_CLAUDE=true && node dist/index.js\"\n     ],\n     \"headers\": {\n       \"x-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. For calendar integration, you can add the `calendarOAuth` section to your `botConfig`:\n   ```json\n   \"botConfig\": {\n     \"calendarOAuth\": {\n       \"platform\": \"Google\",  // or \"Microsoft\"\n       \"clientId\": \"YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID\",\n       \"clientSecret\": \"YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET\", \n       \"refreshToken\": \"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN\",\n       \"rawCalendarId\": \"primary@gmail.com\"  // Optional\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.\n\n> **Note:** Calendar integration is optional. Meeting BaaS can be used without connecting a calendar by simply omitting the `calendarOAuth` section.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to access and manipulate meeting data. It exposes a set of tools and resources that can be used to:\n\n- **Invite Meeting Bots**: Create and invite bots to your video conferences that automatically record and transcribe meetings\n\n  ```\n  \"Create a new meeting bot for my Zoom call tomorrow\"\n  ```\n\n- **Query Meeting Data**: Search through meeting transcripts and find specific information without watching entire recordings\n\n  ```\n  \"Search my recent meetings for discussions about the quarterly budget\"\n  \"Find all mentions of Project Apollo in yesterday's team meeting\"\n  \"Show me parts of the meeting where Jane was speaking\"\n  ```\n\n- **Manage Calendar Events**: View and organize calendar entries and upcoming meetings\n\n- **Access Recording Information**: Get metadata about meeting recordings and their status\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v16 or later)\n- npm\n- **MeetingBaaS Account**: You need access to a MeetingBaaS account using your corporate email address\n  - All logs, bots, and shared links are available to colleagues with the same corporate domain (not personal emails like gmail.com)\n  - This enables seamless collaboration where all team members can access meeting recordings and transcripts created by anyone in your organization\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd mcp-baas\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3.

Generate a QR code with your contact information and a custom design:\n\n   ```\n   \"Generate a QR code with the following parameters:\n   - Type: email\n   - To: john.doe@company.com\n   - Prompt: Create a professional-looking QR code with abstract blue patterns that resemble a corporate logo\n   - Style: style_crystal\"\n   ```\n\n2. Use the generated QR code as a bot avatar in a meeting:\n\n   ```\n   \"Join my Zoom meeting at https://zoom.us/j/123456789 with the following parameters:\n   - Bot name: QR Code Assistant\n   - Bot image: [URL from the generated QR code]\n   - Entry message: Hello everyone, I'm here to record the meeting. You can scan my avatar to get my contact information.\"\n   ```\n\n3. Generate a QR code with a meeting link for easy sharing:\n\n   ```\n   \"Generate a QR code with the following parameters:\n   - Type: url\n   - To: https://zoom.us/j/123456789\n   - Prompt: Create a colorful QR code with a calendar icon in the center\n   - Style: style_rounded\"\n   ```\n\n### Accessing Meeting Recordings\n\nMeeting recordings can be accessed directly through the Meeting BaaS viewer using the bot ID:\n\n```\nhttps://meetingbaas.com/viewer/{BOT_ID}\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://meetingbaas.com/viewer/67738f48-2360-4f9e-a999-275a74208ff5\n```\n\nThis viewer provides:\n- The meeting video recording\n- Synchronized transcript with speaker identification\n- Navigation by speaker or topic\n- Direct link sharing with teammates\n\nWhen using the `createBot`, `getBots`, or search tools, you'll receive bot IDs that can be used to construct these viewer URLs for easy access to recordings.\n\n> **Important**: All meeting recordings and links are automatically shared with colleagues who have the same corporate email domain (e.g., @yourcompany.com). This allows your entire team to access recordings without requiring individual permissions, creating a collaborative environment where meeting knowledge is accessible to everyone in your organization.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server can be configured through environment variables or by editing the `src/config.ts` file.\n\nKey configuration options:\n\n- `PORT`: The port the server listens on (default: 7017)\n- `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Meeting BaaS API\n- `DEFAULT_API_KEY`: Default API key for testing\n\n## Integration with Cursor\n\nTo integrate with Cursor:\n\n1. Open Cursor\n2. Go to Settings\n3. Navigate to \"Model Context Protocol\"\n4. Add a new server with:\n   - Name: \"Meeting BaaS MCP\"\n   - Type: \"sse\"\n   - Server URL: \"http://localhost:7017/mcp\"\n   - Optionally add headers if authentication is required\n\n## Development\n\n### Build\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Test with MCP Inspector\n\n```bash\nnpm run inspect\n```\n\n### Development mode (with auto-reload)\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Log Management\n\nThe server includes optimized logging with:\n\n```bash\nnpm run cleanup\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Cleans up unnecessary log files and cached data\n- Filters out repetitive ping messages from logs\n- Reduces disk usage while preserving important log information\n- Maintains a smaller log footprint for long-running servers\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point\n- `src/tools/`: Tool implementations\n- `src/resources/`: Resource definitions\n- `src/api/`: API client for the Meeting BaaS backend\n- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions\n- `src/config.ts`: Server configuration\n- `src/utils/`: Utility functions\n  - `logging.ts`: Log filtering and management\n  - `tinyDb.ts`: Persistent bot tracking database\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe server expects an API key in the `x-api-key` header for authentication. You can configure the default API key in the configuration.\n\nDirect authentication is also supported in many tools (named with \"WithCredentials\") where you can provide the API key directly as a parameter rather than in headers.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n## QR Code API Key Configuration\n\nThe QR code generator tool requires an API key from QR Code AI API. There are several ways to provide this:\n\n1. **Directly in the prompt**: Include your API key directly in the prompt text when using the `generateQRCode` tool, e.g., \"Generate a QR code for my website https://example.com with API key: qrc_your_key\"\n\n2. **As a parameter**: Provide your API key as the `apiKey` parameter when using the `generateQRCode` tool\n\n3. **Environment variable**: Set the `QRCODE_API_KEY` environment variable\n\n4. **Claude Desktop config**: Add the API key to your Claude Desktop configuration file located at:\n   - Mac/Linux: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n   Example configuration:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"headers\": {\n       \"x-api-key\": \"qrc_your_key_here\" \n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nThe tool will check for the API key in the order listed above. If no API key is provided, the default API key will be used if available.\n\nYou can obtain an API key by signing up at [QR Code AI API](https://qrcode-ai.com).\n\n\n",

Create an auth_cache folder in the project root (see note):\n```BASH\nmkdir -p auth_cache\n```\n\n2. Create a .env file in the project root\n```bash\ntouch .env\n```\n3. Add the following to the .env:\n```BASH\necho \"AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<your-id-from-Azure-portal-here>\" > .env\necho \"AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-id-from-Azure-portal-here>\" >> .env\necho \"AZURE_GRAPH_SCOPES=User.Read Mail.Read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite\" >> .env\n```\nNOTE: Additional .env values required for file services\nNOTE: On first run, the application will authenticate using the DeviceCodeCredential flow and will create auth_record.json in the auth_cache folder automatically if successful.\n\n### You must have admin access to an Azure tenant to register an application with these permissions.\n\n---\n## Claude for Desktop Integration\n\nTo integrate with Claude Desktop, add this to your claude_desktop_config.json:\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"outlook\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--with\",\n        \"azure-identity,mcp[cli],msgraph-core,msgraph-sdk\",\n        \"mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"/absolute/path/to/OutlookMCPServer\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nIn Claude Desktop, you can find the json file by looking in Settings/Developer/Edit Config.\n\nNOTE: You may need to replace \"uv\" with an absolute reference in \"command\"\n\n### Restart Claude Desktop each time you make a change to config or to the server code.\n\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Folder Structure\n```\n.\n├── README.md\n├── main.py\n├── settings.py\n├── auth_cache/\n│   └── auth_record.json\n├── mcpserver/\n│   └── graph/\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       ├── calendar_service.py\n│       ├── controller.py\n│       ├── file_service.py\n│       ├── mail_service.py\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── auth_wrapper.py\n│   ├── context_manager.py\n│   ├── mail_query.py\n│   ├── message_info.py\n│   └── server.py\n├── tests/\n├── .env\n├── __init__.py\n├── main.py\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Roadmap\n- Mail integration (DONE)\n- Auth in Claude Desktop (DONE)\n- Calendar integration (DONE)\n- OneDrive integration (DONE)\n- Sharepoint integration (DONE)\n---\n\n## 📄 License\n### MIT\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 Enthoosa AI\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

A Google Cloud project with the Calendar API enabled\n2. OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)\n\n### Google Cloud Setup\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one.\n3. Enable the [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com) for your project. Ensure that the right project is selected from the top bar before enabling the API.\n4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:\n   - Go to Credentials\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Choose \"User data\" for the type of data that the app will be accessing\n   - Add your app name and contact information\n   - Add the following scopes (optional):\n     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`\n   - Select \"Desktop app\" as the application type (Important!)\n   - Save the auth key, you'll need to add its path to the JSON in the next step\n   - Add your email address as a test user under the [Audience screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)\n      - Note: it might take a few minutes for the test user to be added. The OAuth consent will not allow you to proceed until the test user has propagated.\n      - Note about test mode: While an app is in test mode the auth tokens will expire after 1 week and need to be refreshed (see Re-authentication section below).\n\n### Installation\n\n**Option 1: Use with npx (Recommended)**\n\nAdd to your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@cocal/google-calendar-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS\": \"/path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**⚠️ Important Note for npx Users**: When using npx, you **must** specify the credentials file path using the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n**Option 2: Local Installation**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp.git\ncd google-calendar-mcp\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen add to Claude Desktop config using the local path or by specifying the path with the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n**Option 3: Docker Installation**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp.git\ncd google-calendar-mcp\ncp /path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json .\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nSee the [Docker deployment guide](docs/docker.md) for detailed configuration options including HTTP transport mode.\n\n### First Run\n\n1. Start Claude Desktop\n2. The server will prompt for authentication on first use\n3. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser\n4. You're ready to use calendar features!\n\n### Re-authentication\n\nIf you're in test mode (default), tokens expire after 7 days. If you are using a client like Claude Desktop it should open up a browser window to automatically re-auth. However, if you see authentication errors you can also resolve by following these steps:\n\n**For npx users:**\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json\"\nnpx @cocal/google-calendar-mcp auth\n```\n\n**For local installation:**\n```bash\nnpm run auth\n```\n\n**To avoid weekly re-authentication**, publish your app to production mode (without verification):\n1. Go to Google Cloud Console → \"APIs & Services\" → \"OAuth consent screen\"\n2. Click \"PUBLISH APP\" and confirm\n3. Your tokens will no longer expire after 7 days but Google will show a more threatning warning when connecting to the app about it being unverified. \n\nSee [Authentication Guide](docs/authentication.md#moving-to-production-mode-recommended) for details.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nAlong with the normal capabilities you would expect for a calendar integration you can also do really dynamic, multi-step processes like:\n\n1. **Cross-calendar availability**:\n   ```\n   Please provide availability looking at both my personal and work calendar for this upcoming week.\n   I am looking for a good time to meet with someone in London for 1 hr.\n   ```\n\n2. Add events from screenshots, images and other data sources:\n   ```\n   Add this event to my calendar based on the attached screenshot.\n   ```\n   Supported image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF\n   Images can contain event details like date, time, location, and description\n\n3. Calendar analysis:\n   ```\n   What events do I have coming up this week that aren't part of my usual routine?\n   ```\n4. Check attendance:\n   ```\n   Which events tomorrow have attendees who have not accepted the invitation?\n   ```\n5. Auto coordinate events:\n   ```\n   Here's some available that was provided to me by someone. {available times}\n   Take a look at the times provided and let me know which ones are open on my calendar.\n   ```\n\n## Available Tools\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `list-calendars` | List all available calendars |\n| `list-events` | List events with date filtering |\n| `search-events` | Search events by text query |\n| `create-event` | Create new calendar events |\n| `update-event` | Update existing events |\n| `delete-event` | Delete events |\n| `get-freebusy` | Check availability across calendars, including external calendars |\n| `list-colors` | List available event colors |\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Authentication Setup](docs/authentication.md) - Detailed Google Cloud setup\n- [Advanced Usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) - Multi-account, batch operations\n- [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) - HTTP transport, remote access\n- [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md) - Docker deployment with stdio and HTTP modes\n- [OAuth Verification](docs/oauth-verification.md) - Moving from test to production mode\n- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - Technical architecture overview\n- [Development](docs/development.md) - Contributing and testing\n- [Testing](docs/testing.md) - Unit and integration testing guide\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` - Path to OAuth credentials file\n- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_MCP_TOKEN_PATH` - Custom token storage location (optional)\n\n**Claude Desktop Config Location:**\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n\n## Security\n\n- OAuth tokens are stored securely in your system's config directory\n- Credentials never leave your local machine\n- All calendar operations require explicit user consent\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **OAuth Credentials File Not Found:**\n   - For npx users: You **must** specify the credentials file path using `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS`\n   - Verify file paths are absolute and accessible\n\n2. **Authentication Errors:**\n   - Ensure your credentials file contains credentials for a **Desktop App** type\n   - Verify your user email is added as a **Test User** in the Google Cloud OAuth Consent screen\n   - Try deleting saved tokens and re-authenticating\n   - Check that no other process is blocking ports 3000-3004\n\n3. **Build Errors:**\n   - Run `npm install && npm run build` again\n   - Check Node.js version (use LTS)\n   - Delete the `build/` directory and run `npm run build`\n4. **\"Something went wrong\" screen during browser authentication**\n   - Perform manual authentication per the below steps\n   - Use a Chromium-based browser to open the authentication URL. Test app authentication may not be supported on some non-Chromium browsers.\n\n### Manual Authentication\nFor re-authentication or troubleshooting:\n```bash\n# For npx installations\nexport GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/credentials.json\"\nnpx @cocal/google-calendar-mcp auth\n\n# For local installations\nnpm run auth\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Support\n\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp/issues)\n- [Documentation](docs/)\n",

      "readme_content": "# MCP DateTime\n\nA TypeScript implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides datetime and timezone information to agentic systems and chat REPLs.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP DateTime is a simple server that implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/model-context-protocol/mcp) to provide datetime and timezone information to AI agents and chat interfaces. It allows AI systems to:\n\n- Get the current time in the local system timezone\n- Get the current time in any valid timezone\n- List all available timezones\n- Access timezone information through URI resources\n\n## Installation\n\n### From npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g mcp-datetime\n```\n\n### From source\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/odgrmi/mcp-datetime.git\ncd mcp-datetime\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command Line\n\nMCP DateTime can be run in two modes:\n\n#### 1. Standard I/O Mode (Default)\n\nThis mode is ideal for integrating with AI systems that support the MCP protocol through standard input/output:\n\n```bash\nmcp-datetime\n```\n\n#### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Mode\n\nThis mode starts an HTTP server that provides SSE transport for the MCP protocol:\n\n```bash\nmcp-datetime --sse\n```\n\nYou can also specify a custom port and URI prefix:\n\n```bash\nmcp-datetime --sse --port=8080 --prefix=/api/datetime\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n- `PORT`: Sets the port for SSE mode (default: 3000)\n- `URI_PREFIX`: Sets the URI prefix for SSE mode (default: none)\n\n## Available Tools\n\nMCP DateTime provides the following tools:\n\n### `get-current-time`\n\nReturns the current time in the system's local timezone.\n\n### `get-current-timezone`\n\nReturns the current system timezone.\n\n### `get-time-in-timezone`\n\nReturns the current time in a specified timezone.\n\nParameters:\n- `timezone`: The timezone to get the current time for (e.g., \"America/New_York\")\n\n### `list-timezones`\n\nReturns a list of all available timezones.\n\n## Resource URIs\n\nMCP DateTime also provides access to timezone information through resource URIs:\n\n### `datetime://{timezone}`\n\nReturns the current time in the specified timezone.\n\nExample: `datetime://America/New_York`\n\n### `datetime://list`\n\nReturns a list of all available timezones.\n\n## Common Timezones\n\nThe following common timezones are always available:\n\n- UTC\n- Europe/London\n- Europe/Paris\n- Europe/Berlin\n- America/New_York\n- America/Chicago\n- America/Denver\n- America/Los_Angeles\n- Asia/Tokyo\n- Asia/Shanghai\n- Asia/Kolkata\n- Australia/Sydney\n- Pacific/Auckland\n\n## SSE Endpoints\n\nWhen running in SSE mode, the following endpoints are available:\n\n- `/sse`: SSE connection endpoint\n- `/message`: Message endpoint for client-to-server communication\n- `/info`: Basic server information\n\nIf a URI prefix is specified, it will be prepended to all endpoints.\n\n## Integration with AI Systems\n\nMCP DateTime can be integrated with AI systems that support the Model Context Protocol.

Just specify the Google calendar when creating/updating events.\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n> 💡 **Note**: While these instructions focus on setting up the MCP server with Claude for Desktop, this server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. For more details on using different clients, see [the MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [uv package manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)\n- macOS with Calendar app configured\n- An MCP client - [Claude for desktop](https://claude.ai/download) is recommended\n\n### Installation\n\nWhilst this MCP server can be used with any MCP compatible client, the instructions below are for use with Claude for desktop.\n\n1. **Clone and Setup**\n\n    ```bash\n    # Clone the repository\n    git clone https://github.com/Omar-V2/mcp-ical.git\n    cd mcp-ical\n\n    # Install dependencies\n    uv sync\n    ```\n\n2. **Configure Claude for Desktop**\n\n    Create or edit `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n            \"mcp-ical\": {\n                \"command\": \"uv\",\n                \"args\": [\n                    \"--directory\",\n                    \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-ical\",\n                    \"run\",\n                    \"mcp-ical\"\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. **Launch Claude for Calendar Access**\n\n    > ⚠️ **Critical**: Claude must be launched from the terminal to properly request calendar permissions. Launching directly from Finder will not trigger the permissions prompt.\n\n    Run the following command in your terminal.\n\n    ```bash\n    /Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/Claude\n    ```\n\n    > ⚠️ **Warning**: Alternatively, you can [manually grant calendar access](docs/install.md#method-2-manually-grant-calendar-access), but this involves modifying system files and should only be done if you understand the risks involved.\n\n4. **Start Using!**\n\n    ```text\n    Try: \"What's my schedule looking like for next week?\"\n    ```\n\n> 🔑 **Note**: When you first use a calendar-related command, macOS will prompt for calendar access. This prompt will only appear if you launched Claude from the terminal as specified above.\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning**: Tests will create temporary calendars and events. While cleanup is automatic, only run tests in development environments.\n\n```bash\n# Install dev dependencies\nuv sync --dev\n\n# Run test suite\nuv run pytest tests\n```\n\n## 🐛 Known Issues\n\n### Recurring Events\n\n- Non-standard recurring schedules may not always be set correctly\n- Better results with Claude 3.5 Sonnet compared to Haiku\n- Reminder timing for recurring all-day events may be off by one day\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nFeedback and contributions are welcome. Here's how you can help:\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create your feature branch\n3. Commit your changes\n4. Push to the branch\n5. Open a Pull Request\n\n## 📝 License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## 🙏 Acknowledgments\n\n- Built with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)\n- macOS Calendar integration built with [PyObjC](https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/pyobjc)\n",

      "readme_content": "TaskaDoo  \nVersion: 1.0  \nAuthor(s): Team Rododendron\nDate: February 18, 2025 \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTable of Contents\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1. App Overview  \n2. App Mechanics  \n3. Visual Style  \n4. Sound  \n5. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)  \n6. Technical Specifications  \n7. Production Plan  \n8. Appendices  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nApp Overview\n------------------------------------------------------------\nHigh Concept:  \nTaskaDoo is a mobile application designed to assist individuals who struggle with daily motivation, organization and time management. By leveraging voice and text inputs, the app helps users plan tasks, create routines, and receive timely reminders to boost productivity and ensure nothing is overlooked.\n\nGenre:  \nProductivity / Personal Organization\n\nTarget Audience:  \n- Individuals with organizational challenges  \n- Neurodiverse users  \n- People with time blindness or difficulty perceiving time  \n\nPlatform:  \nMobile (iOS and Android)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nApp Mechanics\n------------------------------------------------------------\nCore Mechanics:  \n- Task Input: Users can either dictate or type tasks and routines into the app.  \n- Automatic Categorization: The AI processes input, automatically categorizes tasks, and suggests attributes such as date, time, priority (weight), color-coding, and category.  \n- Calendar & Priority Integration: Tasks are organized based on calendar events and weighted priorities to ensure optimal scheduling.  \n- Adaptive Reminders:  \n    - Reminders are issued 30 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes before a task is scheduled to begin.  \n    - Users receive notifications via both voice and visual cues.\n\nUser Interactions:  \n- Response Buttons:  \n    - \"Okay\": Acknowledges the reminder and indicates the user is beginning the task (no further prompts needed).  \n    - \"Don't Want\": Triggers the AI to offer motivational support and reasons why the task is beneficial, aiming to convince the user to proceed.  \n    - \"Postpone\": Allows users to delay a task. In this mode, the user may need to provide a reason, prompting an interactive dialogue with the AI to address possible procrastination.\n\nObjectives:  \n- Enhance daily organization and time management.  \n- Provide adaptive, empathetic, and sometimes assertive guidance to encourage task completion.\n\nControls:  \n- Voice Interaction: Primary input method, with natural language processing to understand and categorize dictated tasks.  \n- Text Input: Optional mode for users preferring or requiring text-based interaction.  \n- Touch Controls: For selecting response buttons and navigating menus.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nVisual Style\n------------------------------------------------------------\nArt Style:  \n- Clean and Minimalistic: A streamlined interface that avoids clutter while emphasizing clarity.  \n- Color-Coding: Tasks are color-coded based on categories and priorities to quickly convey information at a glance.  \n- Mood Boards & Style Guides: Visual references will include modern design elements with both playful and professional touches, ensuring the app remains engaging yet easy to navigate.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSound\n------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic:  \n- Subtle, non-intrusive background music may be integrated to create a calming environment during routine planning and task review sessions.\n\nSound Effects:  \n- Distinctive notification sounds signal reminders and confirm user interactions.  \n- Audio cues help reinforce task priorities and transitions between activities.\n\nVoice Acting:  \n- The AI voice is dynamic, capable of shifting tones to suit user preferences—ranging from a straightforward, no-nonsense prompt (e.g., \"Come on, get to it!\") to a gentle, encouraging tone (e.g., \"Mmm sweetheart, you can do this!\").\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nHUD (Heads-Up Display):  \n- Displays current tasks, upcoming reminders, and calendar events.  \n- Visual indicators (icons, color bands) represent task categories and priorities.\n\nMenus:  \n- Main Menu: Simplified layout with options for task input, calendar view, settings, and report access.  \n- Settings: Customize voice tone, notification intervals, and input preferences (voice/text).\n\nNavigation Flow:  \n- Intuitive swipe and tap gestures guide users from one screen to another.  \n- A clear hierarchy ensures that the most critical functions (task entry, reminders) are always easily accessible.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical Specifications\n------------------------------------------------------------\nEngine/Framework:  \n- Developed using cross-platform frameworks (e.g., React Native or Flutter) to ensure a smooth experience on both iOS and Android devices.  \n- Integrated with advanced AI modules for natural language processing and automatic task categorization.\n\nTechnical Requirements:  \n- Minimum modern smartphone hardware with support for voice recognition.  \n- Operating System: iOS 13+/Android 9+ (or equivalent).\n\nPlatform Specifics:  \n- Optimized for mobile use with considerations for battery usage, offline functionality, and accessibility features (e.g., large fonts, high-contrast mode).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nProduction Plan\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTimeline:  \n- Phase 1: Research & Design (1-2 months)  \n- Phase 2: Development & AI Integration (3-4 months)  \n- Phase 3: Beta Testing & User Feedback (2 months)  \n- Phase 4: Final Adjustments & Launch (1 month)\n\nTeam:  \n- Project Manager: Oversees the timeline and coordinates between departments.  \n- Developers: Responsible for coding, integration, and maintenance.  \n- UI/UX Designers: Craft a user-friendly interface and intuitive experience.  \n- AI/ML Specialists: Develop and refine voice recognition, natural language processing, and adaptive response algorithms.  \n- QA Testers: Ensure the app runs smoothly across devices and meets user needs.\n\nBudget:  \n- Allocation for research and design, development resources, AI integration, beta testing, marketing, and post-launch support.  \n- A contingency fund is reserved for unforeseen challenges, such as further voice recognition refinements.\n\nRisk Assessment:  \n- Voice Recognition Accuracy: Mitigated by continuous AI training and feedback loops.  \n- User Adoption: Focus groups and beta testing with target demographics to refine usability and accessibility.  \n- Technical Limitations: Ensuring broad device compatibility and smooth operation on lower-end hardware.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAppendices\n------------------------------------------------------------\nGlossary:  \n- Task Weight: A numerical or color-coded representation of a task's priority.  \n- Time Blindness: A cognitive condition where the perception of time is impaired.  \n- Neurodiverse: Individuals whose brain functions differ from the typical pattern, including those with ADHD, autism, etc.\n\nReferences:  \n- Research on productivity apps and cognitive behavioral techniques.  \n- Studies on voice interaction design and

This server enables AI assistants to manage Google Calendar events through natural language interactions.\n\n![](https://badge.mcpx.dev?type=server 'MCP Server')\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@raghavared/calendar-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@raghavared/calendar-mcp)\n[![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)\n\n## Features\n\n- Create calendar events with title, time, description, and location\n- Retrieve event details by event ID\n- Update existing events (title, time, description, location)\n- Delete events\n- List events within a specified time range\n- Full integration with Google Calendar API\n- Simple OAuth2 authentication flow with auto browser launch\n- Support for both Desktop and Web application credentials\n- Global credential storage for convenience\n\n## Installation & Authentication\n\n### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Calendar AutoAuth Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@raghavared/calendar-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @raghavared/calendar-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n1. Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials:\n\n   a. Create a Google Cloud Project:\n      - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n      - Create a new project or select an existing one\n      - Enable the Google Calendar API for your project\n\n   b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:\n      - Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n      - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"OAuth client ID\"\n      - Choose either \"Desktop app\" or \"Web application\" as application type\n      - Give it a name and click \"Create\"\n      - For Web application, add `http://localhost:3000/v2/auth/google/callback` to the authorized redirect URIs\n      - Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys\n      - Rename the key file to `token.json`\n\n2. Run Authentication:\n\n   You can authenticate in two ways:\n\n   a. Global Authentication (Recommended):\n   ```bash\n   # First time: Place token.json in your home directory's .calendar-mcp folder\n   mkdir -p ~/.calendar-mcp\n   mv token.json ~/.calendar-mcp/\n\n   # Run authentication from anywhere\n   npx @raghavared/calendar-mcp auth\n   ```\n\n   b. Local Authentication:\n   ```bash\n   # Place token.json in your current directory\n   # The file will be automatically copied to global config\n   npx @raghavared/calendar-mcp auth\n   ```\n\n   The authentication process will:\n   - Look for `token.json` in the current directory or `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - If found in current directory, copy it to `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - Open your default browser for Google authentication\n   - Save credentials as `~/.calendar-mcp/credentials.json`\n\n   > **Note**: \n   > - After successful authentication, credentials are stored globally in `~/.calendar-mcp/` and can be used from any directory\n   > - Both Desktop app and Web application credentials are supported\n   > - For Web application credentials, make sure to add `http://localhost:3000/v2/auth/google/callback` to your authorized redirect URIs\n\n3. Configure in Claude Desktop:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"@raghavared/calendar-mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Docker Support\n\nIf you prefer using Docker:\n\n1. Authentication:\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/token.json,target=/token.json \\\n  -v mcp-calendar:/path \\\n  -e CALENDAR_OAUTH_PATH=/token.json \\\n  -e \"CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/credentials.json\" \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  mcp/calendar auth\n```\n\n2. Usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-v\",\n        \"mcp-calendar:/path\",\n        \"-e\",\n        \"CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/path/credentials.json\",\n        \"mcp/calendar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe server provides several tools that can be used through the Claude Desktop:\n\n### Create Event\n```json\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Team Meeting\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T10:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"end\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T11:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Weekly team sync\",\n  \"location\": \"Conference Room A\"\n}\n```\n\n### List Events\n```json\n{\n  \"timeMin\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"timeMax\": \"2024-12-31T23:59:59Z\",\n  \"maxResults\": 10,\n  \"orderBy\": \"startTime\"\n}\n```\n\n### Update Event\n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"event123\",\n  \"summary\": \"Updated Meeting Title\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T11:00:00Z\"\n  },\n  \"end\": {\n    \"dateTime\": \"2024-01-20T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Delete Event\n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"event123\"\n}\n```\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- OAuth credentials are stored securely in your local environment (`~/.calendar-mcp/`)\n- The server uses offline access to maintain persistent authentication\n- Never share or commit your credentials to version control\n- Regularly review and revoke unused access in your Google Account settings\n- Credentials are stored globally but are only accessible by the current user\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. **OAuth Keys Not Found**\n   - Make sure `token.json` is in either your current directory or `~/.calendar-mcp/`\n   - Check file permissions\n\n2. **Invalid Credentials Format**\n   - Ensure your OAuth keys file contains either `web` or `installed` credentials\n   - For web applications, verify the redirect URI is correctly configured\n\n3. **Port Already in Use**\n   - If port 3000 is already in use, please free it up before running authentication\n   - You can find and stop the process using that port\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Without this flag, only personal\naccount features (email, calendar, OneDrive, etc.) are available.\n\n## Shared Mailbox Access\n\nTo access shared mailboxes, you need:\n\n1. **Organization mode**: Shared mailbox tools require `--org-mode` flag (work/school accounts only)\n2. **Delegated permissions**: `Mail.Read.Shared` or `Mail.Send.Shared` scopes\n3. **Exchange permissions**: The signed-in user must have been granted access to the shared mailbox\n4. **Usage**: Use the shared mailbox's email address as the `user-id` parameter in the shared mailbox tools\n\n**Finding shared mailboxes**: Use the `list-users` tool to discover available users and shared mailboxes in your\norganization.\n\nExample: `list-shared-mailbox-messages` with `user-id` set to `shared-mailbox@company.com`\n\n## Quick Start Example\n\nTest login in Claude Desktop:\n\n![Login example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27f57f0e-57b8-4366-a8d1-c0bdab79900c)\n\n## Examples\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed275100-72e8-4924-bcf2-cd8e1b4c6f3a)\n\n## Integration\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\nTo add this MCP server to Claude Desktop:\n\nEdit the config file under Settings > Developer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"ms365\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@softeria/ms-365-mcp-server\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Claude Code CLI\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add ms365 -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server\n```\n\nFor other interfaces that support MCPs, please refer to their respective documentation for the correct\nintegration method.\n\n### Local Development\n\nFor local development or testing:\n\n```bash\n# From the project directory\nclaude mcp add ms -- npx tsx src/index.ts --org-mode\n```\n\nOr configure Claude Desktop manually:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"ms365\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/absolute/path/to/ms-365-mcp-server/dist/index.js\", \"--org-mode\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Note**: Run `npm run build` after code changes to update the `dist/` folder.\n\n### Authentication\n\n> ⚠️ You must authenticate before using tools.\n\nThe server supports three authentication methods:\n\n#### 1. Device Code Flow (Default)\n\nFor interactive authentication via device code:\n\n- **MCP client login**:\n  - Call the `login` tool (auto-checks existing token)\n  - If needed, get URL+code, visit in browser\n  - Use `verify-login` tool to confirm\n- **CLI login**:\n  ```bash\n  npx @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --login\n  ```\n  Follow the URL and code prompt in the terminal.\n\nTokens are cached securely in your OS credential store (fallback to file).\n\n#### 2. OAuth Authorization Code Flow (HTTP mode only)\n\nWhen running with `--http`, the server **requires** OAuth authentication:\n\n```bash\nnpx @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server --http 3000\n```\n\nThis mode:\n\n- Advertises OAuth capabilities to MCP clients\n- Provides OAuth endpoints at `/auth/*` (authorize, token, metadata)\n- **Requires** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for all MCP requests\n- Validates tokens with Microsoft Graph API\n- **Disables** login/logout tools by default (use `--enable-auth-tools` to enable them)\n\nMCP clients will automatically handle the OAuth flow when they see the advertised capabilities.\n\n##### Setting up Azure AD for OAuth Testing\n\nTo use OAuth mode with custom Azure credentials (recommended for production), you'll need to set up an Azure AD app\nregistration:\n\n1. **Create Azure AD App Registration**:\n\n- Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n- Navigate to Azure Active Directory → App registrations → New registration\n- Set name: \"MS365 MCP Server\"\n\n1. **Configure Redirect URIs**:\n   Add these redirect URIs for testing with MCP Inspector (`npm run inspector`):\n\n- `http://localhost:6274/oauth/callback`\n- `http://localhost:6274/oauth/callback/debug`\n- `http://localhost:3000/callback` (optional, for server callback)\n\n1. **Get Credentials**:\n\n- Copy the **Application (client) ID** from Overview page\n- Go to Certificates & secrets → New client secret → Copy the secret value\n\n1. **Configure Environment Variables**:\n   Create a `.env` file in your project root:\n   ```env\n   MS365_MCP_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-ad-app-client-id-here\n   MS365_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-ad-app-client-secret-here\n   MS365_MCP_TENANT_ID=common\n   ```\n\nWith these configured, the server will use your custom Azure app instead of the built-in one.\n\n#### 3. Bring Your Own Token (BYOT)\n\nIf you are running ms-365-mcp-server as part of a larger system that manages Microsoft OAuth tokens externally, you can\nprovide an access token directly to this MCP server:\n\n```bash\nMS365_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN=your_oauth_token npx @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server\n```\n\nThis method:\n\n- Bypasses the interactive authentication flows\n- Use your pre-existing OAuth token for Microsoft Graph API requests\n- Does not handle token refresh (token lifecycle management is your responsibility)\n\n> **Note**: HTTP mode requires authentication. For unauthenticated testing, use stdio mode with device code flow.\n>\n> **Authentication Tools**: In HTTP mode, login/logout tools are disabled by default since OAuth handles authentication.\n> Use `--enable-auth-tools` if you need them available.\n\n## CLI Options\n\nThe following options can be used when running ms-365-mcp-server directly from the command line:\n\n```\n--login           Login using device code flow\n--logout          Log out and clear saved credentials\n--verify-login    Verify login without starting the server\n--org-mode        Enable organization/work mode from start (includes Teams, SharePoint, etc.)\n--work-mode       Alias for --org-mode\n--force-work-scopes Backwards compatibility alias for --org-mode (deprecated)\n```\n\n### Server Options\n\nWhen running as an MCP server, the following options can be used:\n\n```\n-v                Enable verbose logging\n--read-only       Start server in read-only mode, disabling write operations\n--http [port]     Use Streamable HTTP transport instead of stdio (optionally specify port, default: 3000)\n                  Starts Express.js server with MCP endpoint at /mcp\n--enable-auth-tools Enable login/logout tools when using HTTP mode (disabled by default in HTTP mode)\n--enabled-tools <pattern> Filter tools using regex pattern (e.g., \"excel|contact\" to enable Excel and Contact tools)\n```\n\nEnvironment variables:\n\n- `READ_ONLY=true|1`: Alternative to --read-only flag\n- `ENABLED_TOOLS`: Filter tools using a regex pattern (alternative to --enabled-tools flag)\n- `MS365_MCP_ORG_MODE=true|1`: Enable organization/work mode (alternative to --org-mode flag)\n- `MS365_MCP_FORCE_WORK_SCOPES=true|1`: Backwards compatibility for MS365_MCP_ORG_MODE\n- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (default: 'info')\n- `SILENT=true|1`: Disable console output\n- `MS365_MCP_CLIENT_ID`: Custom Azure app client ID (defaults to built-in app)\n- `MS365_MCP_TENANT_ID`: Custom tenant ID (defaults to 'common' for multi-tenant)\n- `MS365_MCP_OAUTH_TOKEN`: Pre-existing OAuth token for Microsoft Graph API (BYOT method)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

This project enables Claude to interact with the user's Google Calendar, providing the ability to display, create, update, and delete calendar events through natural language interaction.\n\n### Core Features\n\n- **Google Calendar integration**: Provides a bridge between Claude Desktop and the Google Calendar API\n- **MCP implementation**: Follows the Model Context Protocol specification for AI assistant tool integration\n- **OAuth2 authentication**: Handles the Google API authentication flow securely\n- **Event management**: Supports comprehensive calendar event operations (get, create, update, delete)\n- **Color support**: Ability to set and update event colors using colorId parameter\n- **STDIO transport**: Uses standard input/output for communication with Claude Desktop\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\nThis project uses:\n\n- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code development\n- **MCP SDK**: Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for integration with Claude Desktop\n- **Google API**: Uses `googleapis` for Google Calendar API access\n- **Hono**: Lightweight and fast web framework for the authentication server\n- **OAuth2 Providers**: Uses `@hono/oauth-providers` for PKCE-enabled OAuth2 flow\n- **Zod**: Implements schema validation for request/response data\n- **Environment-based configuration**: Uses dotenv for configuration management\n- **AES-256-GCM**: For token encryption using Node.js crypto module\n- **Open**: For automatic browser launching during authentication\n- **Readline**: For manual authentication input in server environments\n- **Jest**: For unit testing and coverage\n- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD\n\n## Main Components\n\n1. **MCP Server**: Core server implementation that handles communication with Claude Desktop\n2. **Google Calendar Tools**: Calendar operations (retrieval, creation, update, deletion)\n3. **Authentication Handler**: Management of OAuth2 flow with Google API\n4. **Schema Validation**: Ensuring data integrity in all operations\n5. **Token Manager**: Secure handling of authentication tokens\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThis MCP server provides the following tools for interacting with Google Calendar:\n\n### 1. getEvents\n\nRetrieves calendar events with various filtering options.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `calendarId` (optional): Calendar ID (uses primary calendar if omitted, empty string, null, or undefined)\n- `timeMin` (optional): Start time for event retrieval (ISO 8601 format, e.g., \"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z\"). Empty strings, null, or undefined values are ignored\n- `timeMax` (optional): End time for event retrieval (ISO 8601 format). Empty strings, null, or undefined values are ignored\n- `maxResults` (optional): Maximum number of events to retrieve (default: 10)\n- `orderBy` (optional): Sort order (\"startTime\" or \"updated\"). Defaults to \"startTime\" if empty string, null, or undefined\n\n### 2. createEvent\n\nCreates a new calendar event.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `calendarId` (optional): Calendar ID (uses primary calendar if omitted)\n- `event`: Event details object containing:\n  - `summary` (required): Event title\n  - `description` (optional): Event description\n  - `location` (optional): Event location\n  - `start`: Start time object with:\n    - `dateTime` (optional): ISO 8601 format (e.g., \"2025-03-15T09:00:00+09:00\")\n    - `date` (optional): YYYY-MM-DD format for all-day events\n    - `timeZone` (optional): Time zone (e.g., \"Asia/Tokyo\")\n  - `end`: End time object (same format as start)\n  - `attendees` (optional): Array of attendees with email and optional displayName\n  - `colorId` (optional): Event color ID (1-11)\n  - `recurrence` (optional): Array of recurrence rules in RFC5545 format (e.g., [\"RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR\"])\n\n### 3. updateEvent\n\nUpdates an existing calendar event. The function fetches the existing event data first and merges it with the update data, preserving fields that are not included in the update request.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `calendarId` (optional): Calendar ID (uses primary calendar if omitted)\n- `eventId` (required): ID of the event to update\n- `event`: Event details object containing fields to update (same structure as createEvent, all fields optional)\n  - Only fields that are explicitly provided will be updated\n  - Fields not included in the update request will retain their existing values\n  - This allows for partial updates without losing data\n  - `recurrence` parameter can be updated to modify recurring event patterns\n\n### 4. deleteEvent\n\nDeletes a calendar event.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `calendarId` (optional): Calendar ID (uses primary calendar if omitted)\n- `eventId` (required): ID of the event to delete\n\n### 5. authenticate\n\nRe-authenticates with Google Calendar. This is useful when you want to switch between different Google accounts without having to restart Claude.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- None\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\nWhen adding new functions, modifying code, or fixing bugs, please semantically increase the version for each change using `npm version` command.\nAlso, please make sure that your coding is clear and follows all the necessary coding rules, such as OOP.\nThe version script will automatically run `npm install` when the version is updated, but you should still build, run lint, and test your code before submitting it.\n\n### Code Structure\n\n- **src/**: Source code directory\n  - **auth/**: Authentication handling\n  - **config/**: Configuration settings\n  - **mcp/**: MCP server implementation\n  - **tools/**: Google Calendar tool implementations\n  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Proper typing according to TypeScript best practices\n- Maintaining comprehensive error handling\n- Ensure proper authentication flow\n- Keep dependencies up to date\n- Write clear documentation for all functions\n- Implement security best practices\n- Follow the OAuth 2.1 authentication standards\n- Use schema validation for all input/output data\n\n### Testing\n\n- Implement unit tests for core functionality\n- Thoroughly test authentication flow\n- Verify calendar manipulation against Google API\n- Run tests with coverage reports\n- Ensure security tests are included\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis package is published on npm as `@takumi0706/google-calendar-mcp`:\n\n```bash\nnpx @takumi0706/google-calendar-mcp@1.0.7\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1.

Set up environment variables:\n\n```bash\n# Create a .env file with your Google OAuth credentials\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\nGOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4153/oauth2callback\n# Optional: Token encryption key (auto-generated if not provided)\nTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-byte-hex-key\n# Optional: Auth server port and host (default port: 4153, host: localhost)\nAUTH_PORT=4153\nAUTH_HOST=localhost\n# Optional: MCP server port and host (default port: 3000, host: localhost)\nPORT=3000\nHOST=localhost\n# Optional: Enable manual authentication (useful when localhost is not accessible)\nUSE_MANUAL_AUTH=true\n```\n\n### Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nAdd the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`. If you're running in an environment where localhost is not accessible, add the `USE_MANUAL_AUTH` environment variable set to \"true\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@takumi0706/google-calendar-mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\": \"your_client_id\",\n        \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\": \"your_client_secret\",\n        \"GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI\": \"http://localhost:4153/oauth2callback\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- **OAuth tokens** are stored in memory only (not stored in a file-based storage)\n- **Sensitive credentials** must be provided as environment variables\n- **Token encryption** using AES-256-GCM for secure storage\n- **PKCE implementation** with explicit code_verifier and code_challenge generation\n- **State parameter validation** for CSRF protection\n- **Rate limiting** for API endpoint protection\n- **Input validation** with Zod schema\n\nFor more details, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Maintenance\n\n- Regular updates to maintain compatibility with the Google Calendar API\n- Version updates are documented in README.md\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n\n1. Make sure your Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured\n2. Ensure you have sufficient permissions for Google Calendar API access\n3. Verify your Claude Desktop configuration is correct\n\n### Common Errors\n\n- **JSON Parsing Errors**: If you see errors like `Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 4 (line 1 column 5)`, it's typically due to malformed JSON-RPC messages. This issue has been fixed in version 0.6.7 and later. If you're still experiencing these errors, please update to the latest version.\n- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your Google OAuth credentials\n- **Invalid state parameter**: If you see `Authentication failed: Invalid state parameter` when re-authenticating, update to version 1.0.3 or later which fixes the OAuth server lifecycle management. In older versions, you may need to close port 4153 and restart the application.\n- **Connection Errors**: Make sure only one instance of the server is running\n- **Disconnection Issues**: Ensure your server is properly handling MCP messages without custom TCP sockets\n- **Cannot access localhost**: If you're running the application in an environment where localhost is not accessible (like a remote server or container), enable manual authentication by setting `USE_MANUAL_AUTH=true`. This will allow you to manually enter the authorization code shown by Google after authorizing the application.\n- **MCP Parameter Validation Errors**: If you see error -32602 with empty string parameters, update to version 1.0.7 or later which handles empty strings, null, and undefined values properly.\n\n## Version History\n\n### Version 1.0.7 Changes\n- Enhanced parameter validation for MCP tools to properly handle empty strings, null, and undefined values\n- Fixed MCP error -32602 when empty string parameters were passed to getEvents tool\n- Improved preprocessArgs function to skip empty values, allowing Zod schema defaults to be applied correctly\n- Added comprehensive test coverage for empty parameter handling\n\n### Version 1.0.6 Changes\n- Fixed the scope is not needed in this google calendar mcp server\n\n### Version 1.0.5 Changes\n- Added support for recurring events through the `recurrence` parameter in both `createEvent` and `updateEvent` tools\n- Allows creation and modification of recurring events directly without manual setup\n\n### Version 1.0.4 Changes\n- Maintenance release with version number update\n- No functional changes from version 1.0.3\n- Ensures compatibility with the latest dependencies\n\n### Version 1.0.3 Changes\n- Added new `authenticate` tool to allow re-authentication without restarting Claude\n- Made it possible to switch between different Google accounts during a session\n- Exposed authentication functionality through the MCP interface\n- Enhanced user experience by eliminating the need to restart for account switching\n- Added manual authentication option for environments where localhost is not accessible\n- Implemented readline interface for entering authorization codes manually\n- Added USE_MANUAL_AUTH environment variable to enable manual authentication\n- Updated zod dependency to the latest version (3.24.2)\n- Improved schema validation with the latest zod features\n- Enhanced code stability and security\n- Fixed \"Invalid state parameter\" error during re-authentication\n- Modified OAuth server to start on-demand and shut down after authentication\n- Improved server lifecycle management to prevent port conflicts\n- Enhanced error handling for authentication flow\n\n### Version 1.0.2 Changes\n- Fixed `updateEvent` function to preserve existing event data when performing partial updates\n- Added `getEvent` function to fetch existing event data before updating\n- Modified `updateEvent` to merge update data with existing data to prevent data loss\n- Updated schema validation to make all fields optional in update requests\n- Improved documentation for the `updateEvent` function\n\n### Version 1.0.1 Changes\n- Fixed compatibility issue with Node.js v20.9.0+ and the 'open' package (v10+)\n- Replaced static import with dynamic import for the ESM-only 'open' package\n- Improved error handling for browser opening during OAuth authentication\n- Enhanced code comments for better maintainability\n\n### Version 1.0.0 Changes\n- Major version release marking production readiness\n- Comprehensive code refactoring for improved maintainability\n- Internationalization of all messages and comments (translated Japanese to English)\n- Enhanced code consistency and readability\n- Improved error messages for better user experience\n- Updated documentation to reflect current state of the project\n- Standardized coding style throughout the codebase\n\n### Version 0.8.0 Changes\n- Enhanced OAuth authentication flow to handle refresh token issues\n- Added `prompt: 'consent'` parameter to force Google to show the consent screen and provide a new refresh token\n- Modified authentication flow to work with just an access token if a refresh token is not available\n- Improved token refresh logic to handle cases where there's no refresh token or if the refresh token is invalid\n- Updated token storage to save refreshed access tokens for better token management\n- Fixed potential infinite loop in token refresh logic\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Start (Recommended)\n\nInstall directly from npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @takumi0706/google-calendar-mcp\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nFor development or customization:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/takumi0706/google-calendar-mcp.git\ncd google-calendar-mcp\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Build the project\nnpm run build\n\n# Run the server\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Production Deployment\n\nFor production use, the server requires valid Google OAuth credentials. The server will fail to start without proper credentials, ensuring security compliance.\n\n## Testing\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run tests with coverage report\nnpm test -- --coverage\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Build the server:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n2. The server will automatically start when you open Claude Desktop\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe server provides the following tools:\n\n1. `list_events`: List calendar events within a specified time range\n2. `create_event`: Create a new calendar event\n3. `update_event`: Update an existing calendar event\n4. `delete_event`: Delete a calendar event\n5. `find_free_time`: Find available time slots in the calendar\n\n## Example Usage in Claude\n\nAfter setup, you can use commands like:\n\n- \"Show me my calendar events for next week\"\n- \"Schedule a meeting with [email_id] tomorrow at 2 PM for 1 hour\"\n- \"Find a free 30-minute slot this afternoon\"\n- \"Update my 3 PM meeting to 4 PM\"\n- \"Cancel my meeting with ID [event_id]\"\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **Tools not appearing in Claude:**\n   - Check Claude Desktop logs: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`\n   - Verify all environment variables are set correctly\n   - Ensure the path to index.js is absolute and correct\n\n2. **Authentication Errors:**\n   - Verify your OAuth credentials are correct\n   - Check if refresh token is valid\n   - Ensure required scopes are enabled\n\n3. **Server Connection Issues:**\n   - Check if the server built successfully\n   - Verify file permissions on build/index.js (should be 755)\n   - Try running the server directly: `node /path/to/build/index.js`\n\n### Viewing Logs\n\nTo view server logs:\n```bash\n# For MacOS/Linux:\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n\n# For Windows:\nGet-Content -Path \"$env:AppData\\Claude\\Logs\\mcp*.log\" -Wait -Tail 20\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nIf you're getting environment variable errors, verify each one:\n\n1. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Should start with something like \"123456789-...\"\n2. GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: Usually ends in \".apps.googleusercontent.com\"\n3. GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI: Should be \"http://localhost\"\n4. GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN: A long string that doesn't expire\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Keep your OAuth credentials secure\n- Don't commit credentials to version control\n- Use environment variables for sensitive data\n- Regularly rotate refresh tokens\n- Monitor API usage in Google Cloud Console\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - See LICENSE file for details.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues:\n1. Check the troubleshooting section above\n2. Review Claude Desktop logs\n3. Open an issue on GitHub\n4. Contact the maintainer",

Use your stored refresh token to get new access tokens\n2. Update the token file with the new credentials\n3. Re-initialize all Google services with fresh authentication\n4. Show you the new token expiration time\n\n### Complete Re-authentication\n\nIf you get `invalid_grant` errors or your refresh token has expired, you can start fresh:\n\n```\nRe-authenticate my Google account\n```\n\nThis automated process will:\n\n1. **Delete existing tokens** from your token file\n2. **Start OAuth server** to handle the callback\n3. **Open browser** for fresh authentication\n4. **Save new tokens** automatically\n5. **Re-initialize services** with fresh credentials\n\nYou'll only need to click \"Allow\" in the browser - everything else is automated!\n\n**Note**: If you don't have a valid refresh token, you'll need to go through the initial OAuth authentication flow again.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Prerequisites:\n\n   - Install Bun:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install oven-sh/bun/bun  # macOS/Linux with Homebrew\n   ```\n\n2. Set Up OAuth:\n\n   - Create a Google Cloud project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID, Client Secret).\n   - Choose the type Desktop app.\n   - If using test mode, add your email to the test users list.\n   - Make sure to enable API access for desired services (Gmail, Calendar, Drive etc.).\n\n3. Configure Your Client: Edit your claude_desktop_config.json (or equivalent config file for your client):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"bunx\",\n      \"args\": [\"--no-cache\", \"google-mcp@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        // Either can be used, but not both\n        // Use OAuth\n        \"GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>\",\n        \"GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET\": \"<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>\",\n        \"GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH\": \"<PATH_TO_STORE_TOKENS>\",\n        // Use Service Account\n        \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL\": \"<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>\",\n        \"GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\": \"<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY>\",\n        \"GMAIL_USER_TO_IMPERSONATE\": \"<USER_TO_IMPERSONATE>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Authenticate:\n   - The first time you run the server, it will open a browser for OAuth authentication. Follow the prompts to grant access, and tokens will be saved to GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH.\n\n## Usage\n\nNow, ask Claude to use the `google-mcp` tool.\n\n```\nSend an email to jane.doe@example.com with the subject \"Meeting Notes\" and body \"Here are the notes from today.\"\n```\n\n```\nList my upcoming calendar events for the next 3 days.\n```\n\n```\nCreate a calendar event titled \"Team Sync\" tomorrow at 10 AM for 1 hour.\n```\n\n```\nRefresh my Google OAuth tokens\n```\n\n```\nRe-authenticate my Google account\n```\n\n## Transport Support\n\nThis MCP server supports both stdio and HTTP transports via environment variables:\n\n### Stdio Transport (Default)\n\n```bash\n# Default mode - uses stdio transport\nbun run dev\n# Or explicitly\nMCP_TRANSPORT=stdio bun run index.ts\n```\n\n### HTTP Transport (Streamable HTTP)\n\n```bash\n# HTTP mode with Streamable HTTP support\nMCP_TRANSPORT=http bun run index.ts\n# Or with custom port\nMCP_TRANSPORT=http PORT=3000 bun run index.ts\n```\n\nWhen running in HTTP mode, the server provides these endpoints:\n\n- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint with session count\n- `GET /mcp` - Session info and server status\n- `POST /mcp` - Main MCP JSON-RPC endpoint for sending requests\n- `DELETE /mcp` - End session endpoint\n\n### Session Management\n\nThe Streamable HTTP transport uses the official MCP SDK with automatic session management:\n\n1. **Automatic Sessions**: The server automatically generates secure session IDs\n2. **SSE Streaming**: Supports Server-Sent Events for real-time communication\n3. **JSON Responses**: Falls back to JSON responses when SSE is not available\n4. **DNS Protection**: Built-in security features for production deployment\n\n### Configuration for HTTP Transport\n\nFor HTTP transport, configure your client with the server URL:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-mcp-http\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000/mcp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Local Development\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/vakharwalad23/google-mcp.git\ncd google-mcp\nbun install\n\n# Run in stdio mode (default)\nbun run dev:stdio\n\n# Run in HTTP mode\nbun run dev:http\n```\n\nThank you for using Google MCP Tools! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.\n\nPlay around with the tools and enjoy!!\n",

Defines the tool schemas and descriptions\n- **src/handlers/**: Contains handler functions for each tool\n- **src/scripts/**: Contains AppleScript scripts for interacting with Apple applications\n- **utils/**: Contains utility modules for each Apple service\n\nThe tool uses lazy loading to improve performance, only loading modules when they are needed.\n\n## Security and Permissions\n\nThis tool requires access to various Apple applications and services. You will need to grant permissions when prompted by macOS. These permissions can be managed in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/apple-mcp.git\ncd apple-mcp\n\n# Install dependencies\nbun install\n```\n\n### Running in Development Mode\n\n```bash\nbun run dev\n```\n\n### Code Style\n\n- Use 2-space indentation\n- Keep lines under 100 characters\n- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and returns\n- Follow PascalCase for types, interfaces, and Tool constants\n- Use camelCase for variables and functions\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

Windows compatibility has not been verified.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using mcp-datetime, ensure you have the following tools installed:\n\n- Python 3.12 or later\n- uv (Python package installer)\n- uvx (Python package runner)\n\n## Features\n\n- ✨ Support for various datetime formats\n- 🇯🇵 Japanese language support\n- 📁 Optimized formats for filename generation\n- 🌏 Accurate timezone handling\n- 🔧 Seamless integration with Claude Desktop App\n\n## MCP Server Components\n\n### Tools\n\nThe server implements one tool:\n\n- `get_datetime`: Get current date and time in various formats\n  - Takes \"format\" as a required string argument\n  - Returns formatted datetime string based on specified format\n  - Supports multiple format types including standard, Japanese, and ISO formats\n\n## Usage with Claude Desktop App\n\nAdd the following to your config file:\n\nConfig file location (macOS):\n`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-datetime\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-datetime\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## About Installation\n\nIf you need to install the package directly (e.g., for development or source code inspection), you can use one of these methods:\n\n- Install from PyPI\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install mcp-datetime\n  ```\n\n- Install from GitHub Source\n\n  ```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/ZeparHyfar/mcp-datetime.git\n  cd mcp-datetime\n  pip install -e .\n  ```\n\n- Example `claude_desktop_config.json` for manual installation\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n      \"mcp-datetime\": {\n        \"command\": \"python\",\n        \"args\": [\"-m\", \"mcp_datetime\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"PYTHON\": \"/path/to/your/python\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Replace \"/path/to/your/python\" with your actual Python interpreter path\n  > e.g., \"/usr/local/bin/python3\" or \"/Users/username/.pyenv/versions/3.12.0/bin/python3\"\n\n## Basic Examples\n\n- Command format\n\n  ```\n  # Standard datetime format\n  call datetime-service.get_datetime {\"format\": \"datetime\"}\n  # Result: 2024-12-10 00:54:01\n\n  # Japanese format\n  call datetime-service.get_datetime {\"format\": \"datetime_jp\"}\n  # Result: 2024年12月10日 00時54分01秒\n\n  # Filename format\n  call datetime-service.get_datetime {\"format\": \"filename_md\"}\n  # Result: 20241210005401.md\n  ```\n\n- Claude Desktop App prompt examples\n\n  - User\n\n    ```\n    Please tell me the current time in date_slash format\n    ```\n\n  - Claude\n\n    ```\n    I'll get the current date in date_slash format.\n\n    The current date is 2024/12/12\n    ```\n\n## Supported Formats\n\n| Format Name  | Example                     | Description                  |\n| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| date         | 2024-12-10                  | Standard date format         |\n| date_slash   | 2024/12/10                  | Date with slashes            |\n| date_jp      | 2024年12月10日              | Japanese date format         |\n| datetime     | 2024-12-10 00:54:01         | Standard datetime            |\n| datetime_jp  | 2024年12月10日 00時54分01秒 | Japanese datetime            |\n| datetime_t   | 2024-12-10T00:54:01         | DateTime with T separator    |\n| compact      | 20241210005401              | Compact format for IDs       |\n| compact_date | 20241210                    | Compact date only            |\n| compact_time | 005401                      | Compact time only            |\n| filename_md  | 20241210005401.md           | Markdown filename            |\n| filename_txt | 20241210005401.txt          | Text filename                |\n| filename_log | 20241210005401.log          | Log filename                 |\n| iso          | 2024-12-10T00:54:01+0900    | ISO 8601 format              |\n| iso_basic    | 20241210T005401+0900        | Basic ISO format             |\n| log          | 2024-12-10 00:54:01.123456  | Log format with microseconds |\n| log_compact  | 20241210_005401             | Compact log format           |\n| time         | 00:54:01                    | Time only                    |\n| time_jp      | 00時54分01秒                | Japanese time format         |\n\n## Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):\n\n- Using PyPI package\n\n  ```\n  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-datetime\n  ```\n\n- Using downloaded source code from GitHub\n\n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/ZeparHyfar/mcp-datetime.git\n  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx --directory ./mcp-datetime run mcp-datetime\n  ```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n",
