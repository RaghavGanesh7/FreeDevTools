      "readme_content": "# Building a CSS Tutor MCP Server\n\nThis repo contains a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built with Node.js and TypeScript. It acts as a \"CSS Tutor,\" providing personalized updates about CSS features to a connected AI client.\n\nThis server demonstrates key MCP concepts: defining **Resources**, **Tools**, and **Prompts**. The goal of this demonstration is to help you move on from here and build much larger and more interesting agentic capabilities.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)\n*   `npm` (or your preferred Node.js package manager like `yarn` or `pnpm`)\n*   An AI client capable of connecting to an MCP server (e.g., the Claude desktop app)\n*   An [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/) (for fetching live CSS updates via Perplexity)\n\n## Quick Start\n\nFollow these steps to get the server running quickly:\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/3mdistal/css-mcp-server.git\n    cd css-mcp-server\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install # Or: yarn install / pnpm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Prepare API Key:** The `get_latest_updates` tool requires an OpenRouter API key. Obtain your key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). You will provide this key to your MCP client in Step 5.\n\n4.  **Build the Server:** Compile the TypeScript code.\n    ```bash\n    npm run build # Or: yarn build / pnpm run build\n    ```\n\n5.  **Configure Your MCP Client:** Tell your client how to launch the server *and* provide the API key as an environment variable. Here's an example for the Claude desktop app's `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"css-tutor\": {\n          \"command\": \"node\",\n          \"args\": [\n            \"/full/path/to/your/css-mcp-server/build/index.js\"\n          ],\n          \"env\": {\n            \"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\": \"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    *(Ensure the path in `args` is the correct **absolute path** to the built `index.js` file on your system. Replace the placeholder API key.)*\n\n6.  **Connect:** Start the connection from your MCP client. The client will launch the server process (with the API key in its environment), and you can start interacting!\n\n## Using with Cursor\n\n[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-first code editor that can act as an MCP client. Setting up this server with Cursor is straightforward, but requires an extra step for the guidance prompt.\n\n1.  **Configure Server in Cursor:**\n    *   Go to `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `Add new global MCP server`.\n    *   Paste in the same JSON as above in the Claude Desktop step, with all the same caveats.\n\n2.  **Create a Cursor Project Rule for the Prompt:** Cursor currently does not automatically use MCP prompts provided by servers. Instead, you need to provide the guidance using Cursor's [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) feature.\n    *   Create the directory `.cursor/rules` in your project root if it doesn't exist.\n    *   Create a file inside it named `css-tutor.rule` (or any `.rule` filename).\n    *   Paste the following guidance text into `css-tutor.rule`:\n\n        ```text\n        You are a helpful assistant connecting to a CSS knowledge server. Your goal is to provide the user with personalized updates about new CSS features they haven't learned yet.\n\n        Available Tools:\n        1.  `get_latest_updates`: Fetches recent general news and articles about CSS. Use this first to see what's new.\n        2.  `read_from_memory`: Checks which CSS concepts the user already knows based on their stored knowledge profile.\n        3.  `write_to_memory`: Updates the user's knowledge profile. Use this when the user confirms they have learned or already know a specific CSS concept mentioned in an update.\n\n        Workflow:\n        1.  Call `get_latest_updates` to discover recent CSS developments.\n        2.  Call `read_from_memory` to get the user's current known concepts (if any).\n        3.  Compare the updates with the known concepts (if any). Identify 1-2 *new* concepts relevant to the user. **Important: They _must_ be from the response returned by `get_latest_updates` tool.**\n        4.  Present these new concepts to the user, adding any context as needed, in addition to the information returned by the `get_latest_updates`.\n        5.  Ask the user if they are familiar with these concepts or if they've learned them now.\n        6.  If the user confirms knowledge of a concept, call `write_to_memory` to update their profile for that specific concept.\n        7.  Focus on providing actionable, personalized learning updates.\n        ```\n\n3.  **Connect and Use:**\n    *   Ensure the `css-tutor` server is enabled in Cursor's MCP settings.\n    *   Start a new chat or code generation request (e.g., Cmd+K) and include `@css-tutor-rule` (or whatever you named your rule file) in your request. This tells Cursor to load the rule's content, which includes the instructions on how to use the `read_from_memory`, `write_to_memory`, and `get_latest_updates` tools provided by the connected MCP server. \n\nNote that _without_ the prompt/rule, Cursor will still be able to use individual tools if you ask it to. The prompt provides a workflow and order in which to call the tools and read/write from memory.\n\n## Understanding the Code\n\nThis section provides a higher-level overview of how the server is implemented.\n\n### MCP Concepts Used\n\n*   **Resource (`css_knowledge_memory`):** Represents the user's known CSS concepts, stored persistently in `data/memory.json`.\n*   **Tools:** Actions the server can perform:\n    *   `get_latest_updates`: Fetches CSS news from OpenRouter/Perplexity.\n    *   `read_from_memory`: Reads the content of the `css_knowledge_memory` resource.\n    *   `write_to_memory`: Modifies the `css_knowledge_memory` resource.\n*   **Prompt (`css-tutor-guidance`):** Static instructions guiding the AI client on how to interact with the tools and resource effectively.\n\n### Code Structure\n\nThe code is organized as follows:\n\n*   **`data/memory.json`**: A simple JSON file acting as the database for known CSS concepts. A default version is included in the repo.\n*   **`src/resources/index.ts`**: Defines the `css_knowledge_memory` resource. It includes:\n    *   A Zod schema for validating the data.\n    *   `readMemory` and `writeMemory` functions for file I/O.\n    *   Registration using `server.resource`, specifying the `memory://` URI scheme and read/write permissions. The read handler returns the content of `data/memory.json`.\n*   **`src/tools/index.ts`**: Defines the three tools using `server.tool`:\n    *   `read_from_memory`: Calls `readMemory`.\n    *   `write_to_memory`: Takes `concept` and `known` as input (schema defined with Zod), uses `readMemory` and `writeMemory` to update the JSON file.\n    *   `get_latest_updates`: Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, calls the OpenRouter API using `node-fetch` and the `perplexity/sonar-pro` model, returns the AI-generated summary.\n*   **`src/prompts/index.ts`**: Defines the static `css-tutor-guidance` prompt using `server.prompt`. The prompt text is embedded directly in the code.\n*   **`src/index.ts`**: The main server entry point.\n    *   Initializes the `McpServer` instance from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.\n    *   Imports and calls the `registerPrompts`, `registerResources`, and `registerTools` functions from the other modules.\n    *   Uses `StdioServerTransport` to handle communication over standard input/output.\n    *   Connects the server to the transport and includes basic error handling.\n*   **`package.json`**: Defines dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `dotenv`, `node-fetch`, `zod`) and the `build` script (`tsc`).\n*   **`.env.example` / `.env`**: Used for storing the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (if using Option A for configuration).\n*   **`.gitignore`**: Configured to ignore `node_modules`, `build`, `.env`, and the contents of `data/` except for the default `data/memory.json`.\n*   **`tsconfig.json`**: Standard TypeScript configuration.\n\n## Debugging with MCP Inspector\n\nIf you need to debug the server or inspect the raw JSON-RPC messages being exchanged, you can use the `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` tool. This tool acts as a basic MCP client and launches your server, showing you the communication flow.\n\nRun the inspector from your terminal in the project root:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`: Downloads (if needed) and runs the inspector package.\n*   `node`: The command used to execute your server.\n*   `./build/index.js`: The path (relative to your project root) to your compiled server entry point.\n\n**Environment Variables for Inspector:**\n\nNote that the inspector launches your server as a child process. If your server relies on environment variables (like `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the `get_latest_updates` tool), you need to ensure they are available in the environment where you run the `npx` command. The `.env` file might not be automatically loaded in this context. You can typically prefix the command:\n\n```bash\n# Example on Linux/macOS\nOPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx\" npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n\n# Example on Windows (Command Prompt)\nset OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx && npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n\n# Example on Windows (PowerShell)\n$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx\"; npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n```\n\nReplace `sk-or-xxxxxxxxxx` with your actual key.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThis demo demonstrates the core steps involved in creating a functional MCP server using the TypeScript SDK. We defined a resource to manage state, tools to perform actions (including interacting with an external API), and a prompt to guide the AI client.\n\nHope this demo can help you understand how to build servers that are much more complex (and useful) than this one!\n\n(Also, if you run into any 🐛bugs, feel free to open up an issue.)",

Install the package\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g matlab-mcp-server\n```\n\nOr clone the repository and build it yourself:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/username/matlab-mcp-server.git\ncd matlab-mcp-server\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### 2. Configure cline to use the server\n\nTo use with cline , add the server config:\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"matlab-server\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/matlab-server/build/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MATLAB_PATH\": \"/path/to/matlab/executable\"\n      },\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"autoApprove\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/matlab/executable` with the path to your MATLAB executable:\n- Windows: Usually `C:\\\\Program Files\\\\MATLAB\\\\R2023b\\\\bin\\\\matlab.exe`\n- macOS: Usually `/Applications/MATLAB_R2023b.app/bin/matlab`\n- Linux: Usually `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2023b/bin/matlab`\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:\n\n```bash\nnpm run inspector\n```\n\nThe Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.\n\n[![MseeP.ai Security Assessment Badge](https://mseep.net/pr/williamcloudqi-matlab-mcp-server-badge.png)](https://mseep.ai/app/williamcloudqi-matlab-mcp-server)\n\n[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@WilliamCloudQi/matlab-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@WilliamCloudQi/matlab-mcp-server)\n",

It has compiled based on the author's personal experience and notes from his own interview preparation, when he received offers from Meta (ML Specialist), Google (ML Engineer), Amazon (Applied Scientist), Apple (Applied Scientist), and Roku (ML Engineer).\n\nThe following components are the most commonly used interview modules for technical ML roles at different companies. We will go through them one by one and share how one can prepare:\n\n\n<center>\n\n |Chapter | Content|\n |---| --- |\n | Chapter 1 \t|  [General Coding (Algos and Data Structures)](src/lc-coding.md)\t   | \n| Chapter 2 \t| [ML Coding](src/MLC/ml-coding.md) \t|  \t\n| Chapter 3 \t| [ML System Design (Updated in 2023)](src/MLSD/ml-system-design.md)|\n| Chapter 4 \t| [ML Fundamentals/Breadth](src/ml-fundamental.md)| \n| Chapter 5 \t| [Behavioral](src/behavior.md)| \n|  \t|  \t|  \n\n</center>\n\nNotes:\n\n* At the time I'm putting these notes together, machine learning interviews at different companies do not follow a unique structure unlike software engineering interviews. However, I found some of the components very similar to each other, although under different naming.\n\n* The guide here is mostly focused on *Machine Learning Engineer* (and Applied Scientist) roles at big companies. Although relevant roles such as \"Data Science\" or \"ML research scientist\" have different structures in interviews, some of the modules reviewed here can be still useful. For more understanding about different technical roles within ML umbrella you can refer to [Link]\n\n* As a supplementary resource, you can also refer to my [Production Level Deep Learning](https://github.com/alirezadir/Production-Level-Deep-Learning) repo for further insights on how to design deep learning systems for production. \n\n\n\n# Contribution\n* Feedback and contribution are very welcome :blush: \n**If you'd like to contribute**, please make a pull request with your suggested changes).",

      "readme_content": "# Anki MCP Server\n\nAn MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Claude Desktop that connects to Anki via AnkiConnect and retrieves leech-tagged cards.\n\n## Features\n\n- Connects to Anki via AnkiConnect API\n- Retrieves cards with \"leech\" tags\n- Adds date-stamped review tags to cards\n- Provides comprehensive card data for analysis by Claude\n- Can be used with Claude Desktop\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) installed and running\n- [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on installed in Anki\n- Node.js and npm\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anki-mcp-server.git\n   cd anki-mcp-server\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Build the project:\n   ```\n   npm run build\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe server can be configured using environment variables. Copy the provided example file to create your own configuration:\n\n```\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nThen edit the `.env` file to customize your settings:\n\n| Environment Variable   | Description                                | Default Value           |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |\n| `ANKI_CONNECT_URL`     | The URL of the Anki Connect API            | `http://localhost:8765` |\n| `ANKI_CONNECT_VERSION` | The version of the Anki Connect API to use | `6`                     |\n| `ANKI_MOCK_MODE`       | Enable mock mode for testing (true/false)  | `false`                 |\n\nIf the environment variables are not set, the server will use the default values.\n\n### Finding Your Local IP Address for AnkiConnect\n\nIf connecting to `localhost` doesn't work, you'll need to use your computer's local IP address instead. Configure your `.env` file with:\n\n```\nANKI_CONNECT_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8765\n```\n\nTo find your local IP address:\n\n- **macOS**: Open Terminal and run `ifconfig` or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (for WiFi)\n- **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig`\n- **Linux**: Open Terminal and run `ip addr show` or `hostname -I`\n\nLook for IPv4 addresses like `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x` in the output.\n\n### Test Configuration\n\nFor testing, a separate configuration file `.env.test` is provided:\n\n```\ncp .env.example .env.test\n```\n\nEdit `.env.test` to set test-specific values:\n\n```\nANKI_CONNECT_URL=http://localhost:8765\nANKI_CONNECT_VERSION=6\nANKI_MOCK_MODE=true\n```\n\nTo run in test mode:\n\n```\nnpm run start:test\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Make sure Anki is running with AnkiConnect installed\n2. Run the MCP server:\n   ```\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n## Configuring Claude Desktop\n\nTo use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:\n\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file located at:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n3. Add the following configuration to the `mcpServers` section:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"anki\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"path/to/anki-mcp-server/dist/index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `\"path/to/anki-mcp-server\"` with the actual path to where you cloned this repository.\n\n## MCP Tool Usage\n\nOnce configured, you can use the following tools in Claude:\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```\nCould you analyze my Anki leech cards and suggest ways to improve my study?\n```\n\nClaude will use the MCP server to retrieve your leech cards and analyze them.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### get_leech_cards\n\nRetrieves cards tagged as leeches from Anki.\n\nParameters:\n- `detailed` (optional, boolean, default: true): Whether to return comprehensive card data or just IDs\n- `count` (optional, number): Number of random cards to return (defaults to all cards)\n\n### tag_reviewed_cards\n\nAdds a date-stamped \"reviewed\" tag to specified cards. This allows you to track which cards you've reviewed with Claude.\n\nParameters:\n- `card_ids` (required, array of numbers): Array of card IDs to tag as reviewed\n- `custom_tag_prefix` (optional, string, default: \"見直し\"): Custom prefix for the tag\n\nThe tag will be in the format `見直し::YYYYMMDD` (or your custom prefix if specified).\n\nExample usage in Claude:\n```\nI've reviewed these cards, please tag them as reviewed: [1234567890, 1234567891]\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **\"Could not connect to Anki\"** - Make sure Anki is running and AnkiConnect is properly installed\n- **\"No leech cards found\"** - You don't have any cards tagged as \"leech\" in Anki\n- **Connection issues with localhost** - If you're unable to connect using `localhost`:\n  1. Find your local IP address as described in the Configuration section\n  2. Update your `.env` file to use `ANKI_CONNECT_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8765`\n  3. Make sure AnkiConnect is configured to allow connections from your IP address\n  4. Restart the MCP server after making these changes\n- **Tag not appearing** - Make sure you're providing valid card IDs to the `tag_reviewed_cards` tool\n\n## Testing Mode\n\nFor testing without affecting actual Anki data, you can use the mock mode:\n\n1. Set `ANKI_MOCK_MODE=true` in your `.env` file or use the provided `.env.test` file\n2. Run the server with `npm run start:test`\n\nIn mock mode, the server will simulate all Anki operations without actually connecting to Anki. This is useful for testing Claude integrations without risking data changes.\n\n## Development\n\nTo run the server in development mode with hot reloading:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nFor development with mock mode enabled:\n\n```\nnpm run dev:test\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Configure Claude to use this server by updating `claude_desktop_config.json` (typically in `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"class\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY\\\\index.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Available Tools\n\nThe server provides several tools for interacting with Google Classroom:\n\n#### 1. `courses` - List all your Google Classroom courses\n\n```\nUse the 'courses' tool to get a list of all your Google Classroom courses\n```\n\n#### 2. `course-details` - Get detailed information about a specific course\n\n```\nUse the 'course-details' tool with the courseId parameter to get details and announcements for a specific course\n```\n\nParameters:\n- `courseId`: The ID of the course (can be obtained from the `courses` tool)\n\n#### 3. `assignments` - Get assignments for a specific course\n\n```\nUse the 'assignments' tool with the courseId parameter to get assignments and your submissions for a specific course\n```\n\nParameters:\n- `courseId`: The ID of the course (can be obtained from the `courses` tool)\n\n### Example Prompts for Claude\n\n1. Show me all my Google Classroom courses\n2. Get details for my Math course with ID 123456789\n3. Show me all assignments for my History course with ID 987654321\n\n## Permissions\n\nThe server requests the following Google Classroom API permissions:\n\n- `classroom.courses.readonly` - To access course information\n- `classroom.announcements.readonly` - To access course announcements\n- `classroom.coursework.me.readonly` - To access your coursework and assignments\n- `classroom.rosters.readonly` - To access class rosters\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter permission errors, try:\n\n1. Running the auth command again to refresh permissions:\n   ```\n   node index.js auth\n   ```\n\n2. Ensuring your Google account is added as a test user in the Google Cloud Console if your app is in testing mode\n\n3. Checking the OAuth scopes in the `authenticateAndSaveCredentials` function to ensure they match your needs\n\n## Notes\n\n- This server is designed to be used with Claude AI or other MCP-compatible assistants\n- All API requests are made using your authenticated Google account\n- Token refresh is handled automatically by the server\n- Sensitive credentials are stored locally in the `tokens.json` file\n",

Rember helps you study and remember anything you care about by scheduling spaced repetition reviews.\n\nFeatures and examples:\n\n- **Create flashcards from your chats** _\"... I like your answer, help me remember it\"_\n- **Create flashcards from your PDFs** _\"Create flashcards from chapter 2 of this PDF\"_\n\n![Rember MCP Demo](https://github.com/rember/rember-mcp/blob/main/assets/what-is-active-recall.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Setup\n\nTo run the Rember MCP server using `npx`, use the following command:\n\n```\nnpx -y @getrember/mcp --api-key=YOUR_REMBER_API_KEY\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YOUR_REMBER_API_KEY` with your actual Rember api key, which you can find in your [Settings page](https://rember.com/settings/mcp-api). The API key should follow the format `rember_` followed by 32 random characters.\n\n### Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nAdd the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`. See [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"rember\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@getrember/mcp\", \"--api-key=YOUR_REMBER_API_KEY\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Available tools\n\n- `create_flashcards`: Create flashcards with AI. This tool takes a list of notes from Claude, it calls the Rember API to generate a few flashcards for each note. After learning something new in your chat with Claude, you can ask \"help me remember this\" or \"create a few flashcards\" or \"add to Rember\".\n\n## Best practices for building MCP servers\n\nHere's a collection of lessons we learned while developing the Rember MCP server:\n\n- Set up logging to `stderr` as early as possible, it's essential for debugging\n- Create a simple MCP tool first and verify Claude can call it properly\n- Invest time in iterating on the tool description:\n\n  - Include details about your product and its URL. This serves two purposes: it helps Claude use the tool properly and allows Claude to answer user questions about the product\n  - Clearly explain what MCP is, in a few instances Claude hallucinated that MCP stands for \"Multiple Choice Prompts\", yikes\n  - Describe the tool inputs thoroughly\n  - Explain what happens after Claude calls the tool, we clarify that the input notes array is sent to the Rember API, which generates flashcards for each note\n  - Provide examples of how the tool can be used (e.g., \"create flashcards from a conversation with Claude,\" \"create flashcards from PDFs\"), and give Claude specific instructions for each use case\n  - List examples of how users might invoke the tool (e.g., \"help me remember this,\" \"add to Rember,\" \"create a few flashcards\")\n  - Include a list of rules to guide Claude in using the tool appropriately\n\n- Use the tool call response strategically, it's not shown directly to users but interpreted by Claude:\n  - On success, the Rember API does not return the number of created flashcards, all Claude knows is the number of created rembs. We specify this to Claude because otherwise it tends to hallucinate the number of created flashcards\n  - For users who've reached their monthly limit, we instruct Claude to inform them about the Rember Pro subscription option with the relevant URL\n- Implement retries for transient errors with suitable timeouts\n- We collected enough edge cases that testing manually on Claude Desktop (our main target MCP client) became cumbersome. We created a suite of unit tests by simulating Claude Desktop behavior by calling the Claude API with the system prompt from claude.ai. In the current iteration, each test simulates a chat with Claude Desktop for manual inspection and includes a few simple assertions\n\nWhat's missing:\n\n- Telemetry and observability, currently we are blind if something goes wrong\n- More exhaustive error handling\n- More iterations on the tool description\n- More automated tests\n",

[Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Neural Child Development System represents a groundbreaking approach to artificial intelligence that fundamentally reimagines how neural networks can learn and develop. Instead of following traditional machine learning paradigms, this system implements a sophisticated model of human psychological development, incorporating crucial aspects of cognitive, emotional, and social growth.\n\nThis project emerges from the recognition that current AI systems, while powerful in specific tasks, lack the developmental sophistication that characterizes human intelligence. By implementing a stage-based developmental framework integrated with emotional regulation, attachment theory, and psychological defense mechanisms, this system aims to create AI that develops more naturally and demonstrates genuine emotional intelligence.\n\n### Core Innovation\n\nThe system's primary innovation lies in its integration of developmental psychology with modern neural network architectures. Unlike traditional AI systems that start with full capabilities, this system begins in a \"newborn\" state and progressively develops more sophisticated abilities through interaction and learning, mirroring human developmental stages.\n\n### Key Objectives\n\nThe project addresses several fundamental challenges in AI development:\n- Creating AI systems that develop naturally through defined developmental stages\n- Implementing emotional intelligence as a core feature rather than an add-on\n- Modeling psychological defense mechanisms and trauma processing\n- Developing genuine theory of mind capabilities\n- Creating systems that can form and maintain attachment relationships\n\n## Theoretical Foundations\n\n### Developmental Psychology Integration\n\nThe system's architecture is deeply rooted in established developmental psychology theories, including:\n\n1.

      "readme_content": "# mcp-ankiconnect MCP server\n\nConnect Claude conversations with AnkiConnect via MCP to make spaced repetition as easy as \"Let's go through today's flashcards\" or \"Make flashcards for this\"\n\n## Components\n\n### Tools\n\nThe server implements three tools:\n\n- `num_cards_due_today`: Get the number of cards due today\n  - Optional `deck` argument to filter by specific deck\n  - Returns count of due cards across all decks or specified deck\n\n- `get_due_cards`: Get cards that are due for review\n  - Optional `limit` argument (default: 5) to control number of cards\n  - Optional `deck` argument to filter by specific deck\n  - Optional `today_only` argument (default: true) to show only today's cards\n  - Returns cards in XML format with questions and answers\n\n- `submit_reviews`: Submit answers for reviewed cards\n  - Takes list of `reviews` with `card_id` and `rating`\n  - Ratings: \"wrong\", \"hard\", \"good\", \"easy\"\n  - Returns confirmation of submitted reviews\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Anki must be running with [AnkiConnect plugin](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) installed (plugin id 2055492159)\n  AnkiConnect can be slow on Macs due to the AppSleep feature, so disable it for Anki. To do so run the following in your terminal.\n  ```bash\n  defaults write net.ankiweb.dtop NSAppSleepDisabled -bool true\n  defaults write net.ichi2.anki NSAppSleepDisabled -bool true\n  defaults write org.qt-project.Qt.QtWebEngineCore NSAppSleepDisabled -bool true\n  ```\n\n### Installation\n\n## Quickstart\n\n1. Install the AnkiConnect plugin in Anki:\n   - Tools > Add-ons > Get Add-ons...\n   - Enter code: `2055492159`\n   - Restart Anki\n\n2. Configure Claude Desktop:\n\n   On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n   On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n   Add this configuration:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"mcp-ankiconnect\": {\n         \"command\": \"uv\",\n         \"args\": [\"run\", \"--with\", \"mcp-ankiconnect\", \"mcp-ankiconnect\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Anki and Claude desktop\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\nFirst, clone the repository and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/samefarrar/mcp-ankiconnect.git\ncd mcp-ankiconnect\nuv sync\n```\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via the mcp CLI:\n\n```bash\nuv run mcp dev mcp_ankiconnect/server.py\n```\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n",

      "readme_content": "# Data Engineering Tutor MCP Server\n\nThis repo contains a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built with Node.js and TypeScript. It acts as a \"Data Engineering Tutor,\" providing personalized updates about Data Engineering concepts, patterns, and technologies to a connected AI client.\n\nThis server demonstrates key MCP concepts: defining **Resources**, **Tools**, and **Prompts** to create a stateful, interactive agent helper.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)\n- `npm` (or your preferred Node.js package manager like `yarn` or `pnpm`)\n- An AI client capable of connecting to an MCP server (e.g., Cursor, Claude desktop app)\n- An [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/) (for fetching live Data Engineering updates via Perplexity)\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    # If you haven't already\n    # git clone <repository-url>\n    # cd <repository-directory>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Prepare API Key:** The `de_tutor_get_updates` tool requires an OpenRouter API key.\n\n    - Obtain your key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).\n    - Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy `.env.example`).\n    - Add your key to the `.env` file:\n      ```\n      OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n      ```\n      _(Replace the placeholder with your actual key.)_\n\n4.  **Build the Server:** Compile the TypeScript code.\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run build\n    ```\n\n## Running the Server\n\nYou can run the server directly using Node:\n\n```bash\nnode build/index.js\n```\n\nAlternatively, configure your MCP client (like Cursor or the Claude desktop app) to launch the server. The server name is `de-tutor` and the binary name (if needed for client config) is also `de-tutor`.\n\n**Example Client Configuration (e.g., for Claude Desktop):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"de-tutor\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/full/path/to/your/project/build/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"OPENROUTER_API_KEY\": \"sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n_(Ensure the path in `args` is the correct **absolute path** to the built `index.js` file on your system. You might not need the `env` section here if you are already using the `.env` file, as the server loads it directly via `dotenv`.)_\n\n## Using with Cursor\n\n[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-first code editor that can act as an MCP client. Setting up this server with Cursor requires configuring the server launch and potentially setting up a Project Rule for the guidance prompt, although Cursor might also pick up the server-provided prompt.\n\n1.  **Configure Server in Cursor:**\n\n    - Go to `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `Add new global MCP server`.\n    - Paste in the same JSON as the example client configuration above, ensuring the path to `build/index.js` is correct for your system.\n\n2.  **(Optional) Create a Cursor Project Rule for the Prompt:** If you prefer explicit rules or find Cursor isn't using the server's prompt automatically, you can provide the guidance using Cursor's [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai) feature.\n\n    - Create the directory `.cursor/rules` in your project root if it doesn't exist.\n    - Create a file inside it named `de-tutor.rule` (or any `.rule` filename).\n    - Paste the following guidance text into `de-tutor.rule`:\n\n      ```text\n      You are a helpful assistant connecting to a Data Engineering knowledge server. Your goal is to provide the user with personalized updates about new Data Engineering concepts, patterns, and technologies they haven't encountered yet.\n\n      Available Tools:\n      1.  `de_tutor_get_updates`: Fetches recent general news and articles about Data Engineering. Use this first to see what's new.\n      2.  `de_tutor_read_memory`: Checks which Data Engineering concepts the user already knows based on their stored knowledge profile.\n      3.  `de_tutor_write_memory`: Updates the user's profile to mark whether they have learned or already know a specific Data Engineering concept mentioned in an update.\n\n      Your Workflow:\n      1.  Call `de_tutor_get_updates` to discover recent Data Engineering developments.\n      2.  Call `de_tutor_read_memory` to understand the user's current knowledge base.\n      3.  Present the new developments to the user, highlighting things they likely don't know.\n      4.  If the user confirms they know a concept or have learned it, call `de_tutor_write_memory` to update their profile.\n\n      Be concise and focus on delivering relevant, new information tailored to the user's existing knowledge.\n      ```\n\n3.  **Connect and Use:**\n    - Ensure the `de-tutor` server is enabled in Cursor's MCP settings.\n    - If using a rule file: Start a new chat or code generation request (e.g., Cmd+K) and include `@de-tutor-rule` (or whatever you named your rule file) in your request. This tells Cursor to load the rule's content, providing instructions on how to use the tools.\n    - If relying on the server prompt: Simply start interacting with Cursor; it should have access to the tools and the guidance prompt provided by the server.\n\n## Features & Usage\n\nThis server provides the following capabilities:\n\n- **Resource (`data_engineering_knowledge_memory`):** Stores a simple JSON object in `data/data-engineering-knowledge.json` mapping known concepts (strings) to boolean flags (`true`).\n- **Tools:**\n  - `de_tutor_read_memory`: Reads the current known concepts from the JSON file.\n  - `de_tutor_write_memory`: Updates the JSON file to mark a concept as known (`true`) or unknown (`false`). Takes `concept` (string) and `known` (boolean) as input.\n  - `de_tutor_get_updates`: Uses your OpenRouter API key to query Perplexity (`perplexity/sonar-small-online`) for recent Data Engineering news, patterns, and technologies.\n- **Prompt (`data-engineering-tutor-guidance`):** Provides instructions to the connected AI client on how to use the tools in a workflow:\n  1. Get latest updates.\n  2. Read known concepts from memory.\n  3. Present new information to the user.\n  4. Update memory based on user feedback.\n\n## Development & Debugging\n\n- **Build:** `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `build/` directory.\n- **Code Structure:** See `src/` for implementation details:\n  - `src/index.ts`: Server entry point. Imports `McpServer` and `StdioServerTransport` from specific SDK paths. Instantiates `McpServer`. Imports and calls registration functions (`registerPrompts`, `registerResources`, `registerTools`) from other modules, passing the server instance. Sets up and connects the server using `StdioServerTransport`.\n  - `src/prompts/index.ts`: Defines the guidance prompt text. Exports `registerPrompts`, which takes the `McpServer` instance and uses `server.prompt()` to register the static guidance prompt with its callback.\n  - `src/resources/index.ts`: Exports `KnowledgeMemory` type and helper functions (`readMemoryFile`, `writeMemoryFile`) for file I/O on `data/data-engineering-knowledge.json`. Exports `registerResources`, which takes the `McpServer` instance and uses `server.resource()` to register the `data_engineering_knowledge_memory` resource with a specific URI and a `ReadResourceCallback`.\n  - `src/tools/index.ts`: Exports `registerTools`, which takes the `McpServer` instance and uses `server.tool()` to register each tool (`de_tutor_read_memory`, `de_tutor_write_memory`, `de_tutor_get_updates`). Defines input schemas using Zod where necessary (for `write_memory`). Tool functions use helpers from `resources/index.ts` or `fetch` to perform actions and return results in the expected format.\n- **MCP Inspector:** Use `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` to see raw message flow:\n  ```bash\n  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js\n  ```\n  _(Ensure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in your environment if running this way and not relying solely on the `.env` file loaded by the server itself.)_\n\n## Notes\n\n- This server uses a simple file (`data/data-engineering-knowledge.json`) for storing user knowledge. For more robust applications, consider a proper database.\n- Error handling is basic; production servers would need more comprehensive error management.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nThis demo demonstrates the core steps involved in creating a functional MCP server using the TypeScript SDK and the `McpServer` class. We defined a resource to manage state, tools to perform actions (including interacting with an external API), and a prompt to guide the AI client.\n\nThis provides a foundation for building more complex and useful agentic capabilities with MCP.\n\n(Also, if you run into any 🐛bugs, feel free to open up an issue.)\n",

This was the initial implementation that inspired the creation of the MCP server.\n\n### Features of eClass Client\n\n- Pure Python implementation without MCP integration\n- Handles the complete authentication flow with UoA's SSO system\n- Retrieves course information from eClass\n- Provides clean logout functionality\n\nThis client serves as both:\n1. A reference implementation for understanding the eClass authentication flow\n2. A simpler alternative for projects that don't require MCP integration\n\nYou can run the client directly:\n\n```bash\npython eclass_client.py\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nThe project includes test scripts to verify functionality:\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npython -m src.eclass_mcp_server.test.run_all_tests\n\n# Run specific tests\npython -m src.eclass_mcp_server.test.test_login\npython -m src.eclass_mcp_server.test.test_courses\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nComprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:\n\n- [Documentation Overview](docs/README.md)\n- [How It Works](docs/how-it-works.md)\n- [MCP SDK Integration](docs/mcp-sdk-integration.md)\n- [Tools Reference](docs/tools-reference.md)\n\n## Example MCP Client Usage\n\n```python\nfrom mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters\nfrom mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def run_agent():\n    server_params = StdioServerParameters(\n        command=\"python /path/to/eclass-mcp-server/run_server.py\",\n    )\n    \n    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):\n        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:\n            # Initialize the session\n            await session.initialize()\n            \n            # Login to eClass\n            login_result = await session.call_tool(\"login\", {\n                \"random_string\": \"dummy\"\n            })\n            print(login_result)\n            \n            # Get courses\n            courses_result = await session.call_tool(\"get_courses\", {\n                \"random_string\": \"dummy\"\n            })\n            print(courses_result)\n            \n            # Logout\n            logout_result = await session.call_tool(\"logout\", {\n                \"random_string\": \"dummy\"\n            })\n            print(logout_result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(run_agent())\n```\n\n## Integration with AI Agents\n\nThis MCP server is designed to be used with AI agents that support the Model Context Protocol. This enables AI systems to interact with eClass directly, allowing for capabilities like:\n\n- Retrieving course information\n- Checking course announcements\n- Accessing course materials\n- Submitting assignments (future feature)\n\n## Security\n\nThe eClass MCP Server is designed with security as a top priority, particularly regarding credential handling:\n\n### Local-Only Execution\n\n- **No Cloud Services**: The MCP server runs entirely on your local machine, with no cloud components\n- **No Remote Storage**: Credentials and session data never leave your local environment\n- **User-Controlled**: You maintain complete control over your authentication data\n\n### Credential Protection\n\n- **Environment Variables Only**: Credentials are stored exclusively in the local `.env` file\n- **Never Passed as Parameters**: All tools are designed to use dummy parameters (e.g., `random_string`) \n- **AI Client Isolation**: AI clients (like Claude or other LLMs) never receive your credentials\n  - This prevents credentials from being:\n    - Stored in AI provider logs\n    - Included in model training data\n    - Processed on remote servers\n\n### Session Management\n\n- **In-Memory Sessions**: Session cookies and state are maintained only in memory\n- **No Persistence**: Session data is not stored between runs\n- **Direct Authentication**: The MCP server communicates directly with eClass, with no intermediaries, apart from your University's CAS mechanism.\n\n### Recommended Practices\n\n- Store your `.env` file securely and never commit it to version control\n- Run the server only on trusted machines\n- Dont pass the parameters to an MCP client through any prompts, they will not be used by the Server and will be accessed by the AI Agent provider\n\n## License\n\n### GNU General Public License v3.0\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n#### What this means for you\n\nThe GPL-3.0 license is a strong copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes this code or derivative works to make the source code available under the same terms. Key points:\n\n- **Freedom to use**: You can use this software for any purpose\n- **Freedom to study**: You can examine the source code to see how it works\n- **Freedom to share**: You can redistribute the software\n- **Freedom to modify**: You can adapt the software to your needs\n\n#### Why we chose GPL-3.0\n\nWe chose the GPL-3.0 license to:\n\n1. **Protect user security**: Ensures that any modifications handling credentials must be open source, allowing users to verify security implementations\n2. **Promote sharing**: Encourages contributions back to the community\n3. **Prevent abuse**: Makes it harder for malicious actors to create closed-source derivatives that might compromise security\n4. **Match ecosystem values**: Aligns with the values of the Open eClass platform, which is also open source\n\nThis license is particularly important for this software since it handles authentication and sensitive credentials. The GPL-3.0 ensures that any modifications to this code remain transparent, allowing users to verify how their credentials are being handled.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- [GUnet (Greek Universities Network)](https://github.com/gunet) for developing and maintaining the [Open eClass platform](https://github.com/gunet/openeclass), an open-source learning management system used by academic institutions throughout Greece.\n- The Open eClass platform is distributed as free Open Source Software under GNU GPL v2.0, making projects like this MCP integration possible.\n- Special thanks to the Asynchronous eLearning Team of GUnet for their continuous development and improvement of the eClass platform.\n- This project is an independent interface to the Open eClass system and is not affiliated with or endorsed by GUnet.

      "readme_content": "# Canvas MCP Server\n\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nThis repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for interacting with the Canvas Learning Management System API. The server is designed to work with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.\n\n> **Note**: Recently refactored to a modular architecture for better maintainability. The legacy monolithic implementation has been archived.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Canvas MCP Server bridges the gap between Claude Desktop and Canvas Learning Management System, providing **both students and educators** with an intelligent interface to their Canvas environment. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it enables natural language interactions with Canvas data.\n\n### For Students 👨‍🎓\nGet AI-powered assistance with:\n- Tracking upcoming assignments and deadlines\n- Monitoring your grades across all courses\n- Managing peer review assignments\n- Accessing course content and discussions\n- Organizing your TODO list\n\n**[→ Get Started as a Student](./docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.md)**\n\n### For Educators 👨‍🏫\nEnhance your teaching with:\n- Assignment and grading management\n- Student analytics and performance tracking\n- Discussion and peer review facilitation\n- **FERPA-compliant** student data handling\n- Bulk messaging and communication tools\n\n**[→ Get Started as an Educator](./docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)**\n\n## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection\n\n### For Educators: FERPA Compliance\n\nComplete FERPA compliance through systematic data anonymization when working with student data:\n\n- **Source-level data anonymization** converts real names to consistent anonymous IDs (Student_xxxxxxxx)\n- **Automatic email masking** and PII filtering from discussion posts and submissions\n- **Local-only processing** with configurable privacy controls (`ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`)\n- **FERPA-compliant analytics**: Ask \"Which students need support?\" without exposing real identities\n- **De-anonymization mapping tool** for faculty to correlate anonymous IDs with real students locally\n\nAll student data is anonymized **before** it reaches AI systems. See [Educator Guide](./docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md) for configuration details.\n\n### For Students: Your Data Stays Private\n\n- **Your data only**: Student tools access only your own Canvas data via Canvas API's \"self\" endpoints\n- **Local processing**: Everything runs on your machine - no data sent to external servers\n- **No tracking**: Your Canvas usage and AI interactions remain private\n- **No anonymization needed**: Since you're only accessing your own data, there are no privacy concerns\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Python 3.10+** - Required for modern features and type hints\n- **Canvas API Access** - API token and institution URL\n- **MCP Client** - Claude Desktop (recommended) or other MCP-compatible client\n\n### Supported MCP Clients\n\nCanvas MCP works with any application that supports the Model Context Protocol. Popular options include:\n\n**Recommended:**\n- **[Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)** - Official Anthropic desktop app with full MCP support\n\n**AI Coding Assistants:**\n- **[Zed](https://zed.dev)** - High-performance code editor with built-in MCP support\n- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** - AI-first code editor\n- **[Windsurf IDE](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** (by Codeium) - AI-powered development environment\n- **[Continue](https://continue.dev)** - Open-source AI code assistant\n\n**Development Platforms:**\n- **[Replit](https://replit.com)** - Cloud-based coding platform with MCP integration\n- **[Sourcegraph Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody)** - AI coding assistant with MCP support\n\n**Enterprise:**\n- **[Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio)** - MCP support in enterprise environments\n\nSee the [official MCP clients list](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for more options.\n\n> **Note**: While Canvas MCP is designed to work with any MCP client, setup instructions in this guide focus on Claude Desktop. Configuration for other clients may vary.\n\n## Quick Start (Automated Installation)\n\nThe fastest way to get started is with our automated installer:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp.git\ncd canvas-mcp\n\n# Run the automated installer\npython scripts/install.py\n```\n\nThe installer will:\n- ✅ Set up Python environment with `uv` package manager\n- ✅ Install all dependencies automatically  \n- ✅ Create environment configuration template\n- ✅ Configure Claude Desktop integration\n- ✅ Test the installation\n\n## Manual Installation\n\nIf you prefer manual setup:\n\n### 1. Install Dependencies\n\n```bash\n# Install uv package manager (faster than pip)\npip install uv\n\n# Install the package\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### 2. Configure Environment\n\n```bash\n# Copy environment template\ncp env.template .env\n\n# Edit with your Canvas credentials\n# Required: CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_API_URL\n```\n\nGet your Canvas API token from: **Canvas → Account → Settings → New Access Token**\n\n### 3. Claude Desktop Setup\n\nAdd to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"canvas-api\": {\n      \"command\": \"canvas-mcp-server\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Verification\n\nTest your setup:\n\n```bash\n# Test Canvas API connection\ncanvas-mcp-server --test\n\n# View configuration\ncanvas-mcp-server --config\n\n# Start server (for manual testing)\ncanvas-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe Canvas MCP Server provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Canvas LMS API. These tools are organized into logical categories for better discoverability and maintainability.\n\n### Tool Categories\n\n**Student Tools** (New!)\n- Personal assignment tracking and deadline management\n- Grade monitoring across all courses\n- TODO list and peer review management\n- Submission status tracking\n\n**Shared Tools** (Both Students & Educators)\n1. **Course Tools** -

It also allows you \nto [lint the code](#linting-the-code) you've wrote and check if it fits to Python code style guide.\nAltogether it might make your learning process to be more interactive and it might help you to keep \ncode quality pretty high from very beginning.\n\nIt is a **cheatsheet** because you may get back to these code examples once you want to recap the \nsyntax of [standard Python statements and constructions](#table-of-contents). Also because the \ncode is full of assertions you'll be able to see expected functions/statements output right away\nwithout launching them.\n\n> _You might also be interested in 🤖 [Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments)_\n\n## How to Use This Repository\n\nEach Python script in this repository has the following structure:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"Lists  <--- Name of the topic here\n\n# @see: https://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists  <-- Link to further readings goes here\n\nHere might go more detailed explanation of the current topic (i.e. general info about Lists).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef test_list_type():\n    \"\"\"Explanation of sub-topic goes here.\n    \n    Each file contains test functions that illustrate sub-topics (i.e. lists type, lists methods).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Here is an example of how to build a list.  <-- Comments here explain the action\n    squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n    \n    # Lists can be indexed and sliced. \n    # Indexing returns the item.\n    assert squares[0] == 1  # <-- Assertions here illustrate the result.\n    # Slicing returns a new list.\n    assert squares[-3:] == [9, 16, 25]  # <-- Assertions here illustrate the result.\n```\n\nSo normally you might want to do the following:\n\n- [Find the topic](#table-of-contents) you want to learn or recap.\n- Read comments and/or documentation that is linked in each script's docstring (as in example above). \n- Look at code examples and assertions to see usage examples and expected output.\n- Change code or add new assertions to see how things work.\n- [Run tests](#testing-the-code) and [lint the code](#linting-the-code) to see if it work and is \nwritten correctly.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. **Getting Started**\n    -
