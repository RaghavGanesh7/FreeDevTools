Here's how we can set it up.\n\nFirst, let's generate simulation settings from your natural language description:\n[Tool execution: create_natural_language_simulation_config]\n\nGenerated settings:\n{\n  \"simulationType\": \"traffic\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"region\": \"Tokyo\",\n    \"timeRange\": \"morning_rush\"\n  },\n  \"name\": \"traffic_20250416_123045\"\n}\n\nNext, let's check available simulation data:\n[Tool execution: list_simdata]\n\nFrom this data, I can start a simulation using Tokyo's morning traffic data.\nI've selected the appropriate simulation data ID and will start the simulation:\n[Tool execution: start_simulation]\n\nThe simulation has started. The simulation ID is \"sim_12345\".\nIt will take some time for the results to be available. Once complete, I'll analyze them.\n\n(After simulation completes)\nLet's analyze the simulation results:\n[Tool execution: analyze_traffic_simulation]\n\nAnalysis results:\n- CO2 emissions: 1,250kg\n- Average travel time: 42 minutes\n- Total traffic volume: 15,700 vehicles\n\nFrom these results, I can see that the Shibuya-Shinjuku route experiences particularly severe congestion.\nHere are some potential improvements:\n1. Optimize traffic signal control\n2. Implement one-way traffic on certain roads during specific times\n3. Increase public transportation frequency\n\nWould you like to see a more detailed analysis?\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease report bugs or feature requests via GitHub Issues.

      "readme_content": "# UnrealMCP Plugin\n\n# VERY WIP REPO\nI'm working on adding more tools now and cleaning up the codebase, \nI plan to allow for easy tool extension outside the main plugin\n\nThis is very much a work in progress, and I need to clean up a lot of stuff!!!!!\n\nAlso, I only use windows, so I don't know how this would be setup for mac/unix\n\n## Overview\nUnrealMCP is an Unofficial Unreal Engine plugin designed to control Unreal Engine with AI tools. It implements a Machine Control Protocol (MCP) within Unreal Engine, allowing external AI systems to interact with and manipulate the Unreal environment programmatically.\n\nI only just learned about MCP a few days ago, so I'm not that familiar with it, I'm still learning so things might be initially pretty rough.\nI've implemented this using https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp as a reference, which relies on Claude for Desktop. It now works with both Claude for Desktop and Cursor. If you experiment with other models, please let me know!\n\n## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER\nThis plugin allows AI agents to directly modify your Unreal Engine project. While it can be a powerful tool, it also comes with risks:\n\n- AI agents may make unexpected changes to your project\n- Files could be accidentally deleted or modified\n- Project settings could be altered\n- Assets could be overwritten\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES:**\n1. Always use source control (like Git or Perforce) with your project\n2. Make regular backups of your project\n3. Test the plugin in a separate project first\n4. Review changes before committing them\n\nBy using this plugin, you acknowledge that:\n- You are solely responsible for any changes made to your project\n- The plugin author is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or issues caused by AI agents\n- You use this plugin at your own risk\n\n## Features\n- TCP server implementation for remote control of Unreal Engine\n- JSON-based command protocol for AI tools integration\n- Editor UI integration for easy access to MCP functionality\n- Comprehensive scene manipulation capabilities\n- Python companion scripts for client-side interaction\n\n## Roadmap\nThese are what I have in mind for development as of 3/14/2025\nI'm not sure what's possible yet, in theory anything, but it depends on how\ngood the integrated LLM is at utilizing these tools.\n- [X] Basic operations working\n- [X] Python working\n- [X] Materials\n- [ ] User Extensions (in progress)\n- [ ] Asset tools\n- [ ] Blueprints\n- [ ] Niagara VFX\n- [ ] Metasound\n- [ ] Landscape (I might hold off on this because Epic has mentioned they are going to be updating the landscape tools)\n- [ ] Modeling Tools\n- [ ] PCG\n\n## Requirements\n- Unreal Engine 5.5 (I have only tested on this version, may work with earlier, but no official support)\n- C++ development environment configured for Unreal Engine\n- Python 3.7+ for client-side scripting\n- Model to run the commands, in testing I've been using Claude for Desktop https://claude.ai/download\n\n## Prerequisites to run\n- Unreal Editor Installation (Tested with 5.3, but should work on 5.0+)\n- Python 3.7+ (This can run with your existing python install)\n- MCP compatible LLM (Claude for Desktop, Cursor, etc.)\n- Setup: run setup_unreal_mcp.bat in MCP folder as per instructions in MCP/README_MCP_SETUP.md\n\n## Quick Start for Cursor Users\nIf you want to use UnrealMCP with Cursor, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Clone or download this repository as a zip\n2. Create a new Unreal Project, or open an existing one\n3. Create a \"Plugins\" folder in your project directory if it doesn't exist\n4. Unzip or copy this repository into the Plugins folder\n5. Run `setup_cursor_mcp.bat` in the MCP folder\n6. Open your Unreal project and enable the plugin in Edit > Plugins (if not already enabled)\n7. Start Cursor and ask it to work with your Unreal project\n\nThat's it! The setup script will automatically configure everything needed for Cursor integration.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone or download this repository as a zip\n2. Create a new Unreal Project, or open an existing one\n3. Create a \"Plugins\" folder in your project directory if it doesn't exist\n4. Unzip or copy this repository into the Plugins folder\n5. Setup MCP \n    - Run the `setup_unreal_mcp.bat` script in the MCP folder (see `MCP/README_MCP_SETUP.md` for details)\n    - This will configure Python and your AI assistant (Claude for Desktop or Cursor)\n6. Open your Unreal project, the plugin should be available in the Plugins menu\n7. If not, enable the plugin in Edit > Plugins\n8. Choose your preferred AI assistant:\n    - For Claude for Desktop: follow the instructions in the \"With Claude for Desktop\" section below\n    - For Cursor: follow the instructions in the \"With Cursor\" section below\n\n## With Claude for Desktop\nYou will need to find your installation directory for Claude for Desktop. Find claude_desktop_config.json and add an entry and make it look like so:\n\n**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"unreal\": {\n            \"command\": \"C:/path/to/your/project/Plugins/UnrealMCP/MCP/run_unreal_mcp.bat\",\n            \"args\": []\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively the unreal_mcp_setup.bat script should do this for you.\n\nTo find the path to your claude for desktop install you can go into settings and click 'Edit Config'\nThis is usually in \n```\nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Claude\n```\n\n## With Cursor\nCursor should be automatically configured if you've run the setup script with the Cursor option. If you need to manually configure it:\n\n**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Cursor\\User\\settings.json`\n\nAdd or update the settings with:\n```json\n{\n    \"mcp\": {\n        \"enabled\": true,\n        \"servers\": {\n            \"unreal\": {\n                \"command\": \"C:/path/to/your/project/Plugins/UnrealMCP/MCP/run_unreal_mcp.bat\",\n                \"args\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\nOnce everything is setup you need to launch the unreal editor.\nNote: Nothing else has to be started or set up to run the mcp bridge, it will run when needed.\n\nOpen Claude for Desktop or Cursor, ensure that the tools have successfully enabled, ask your AI assistant to work in Unreal.\n\nHere are some example prompts to try:\n- \"What actors are in the current level?\" \n- \"Create a cube at position (0, 0, 100)\"\n- \"List available commands I can use with Unreal Engine\"\n\n## Usage\n### In Unreal Editor\nOnce the plugin is enabled, you'll find MCP controls in the editor toolbar button. \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68338e7a-090d-4fd9-acc9-37c0c1b63227)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f734ee-65a4-448a-a6db-9e941a588e93)\n\nThe TCP server can be started/stopped from here.\nCheck the output log under log filter LogMCP for extra information.\n\nOnce the server is confirmed up and running from the editor.\nOpen Claude for Desktop, ensure that the tools have successfully enabled, ask Claude to work in unreal.\n\nCurrently only basic operations are supported, creating objects, modfiying their transforms, getting scene info, and running python scripts.\nClaude makes a lot of errors with unreal python as I believe there aren't a ton of examples for it, but let it run and it will usually figure things out.\nI would really like to improve this aspect of how it works but it's low hanging fruit for adding functionality into unreal.\n\n### Client-Side Integration\nUse the provided Python scripts in the `MCP` directory to connect to and control your Unreal Engine instance:\n\n```python\nfrom unreal_mcp_client import UnrealMCPClient\n\n# Connect to the Unreal MCP server\nclient = UnrealMCPClient(\"localhost\", 13377)\n\n# Example: Create a cube in the scene\nclient.create_object(\n    class_name=\"StaticMeshActor\",\n    asset_path=\"/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube\",\n    location=(0, 0, 100),\n    rotation=(0, 0, 0),\n    scale=(1, 1, 1),\n    name=\"MCP_Cube\"\n)\n```\n\n## Command Reference\nThe plugin supports various commands for scene manipulation:\n- `get_scene_info`: Retrieve information about the current scene\n- `create_object`: Spawn a new object in the scene\n- `delete_object`: Remove an object from the scene\n- `modify_object`: Change properties of an existing object\n- `execute_python`: Run Python commands in Unreal's Python environment\n- And more to come...\n\nRefer to the documentation in the `Docs` directory for a complete command reference.\n\n## Security Considerations\n- The MCP server accepts connections from any client by default\n- Limit server exposure to localhost for development\n- Validate all incoming commands to prevent injection attacks\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- Ensure Unreal Engine is running with the MCP plugin.\n- Check logs in Claude for Desktop for stderr output.\n- Reach out on the discord, I just made it, but I will check it periodically\n  Discord (Dreamatron Studios): https://discord.gg/abRftdSe\n  \n### Project Structure\n- `Source/UnrealMCP/`: Core plugin implementation\n  - `Private/`: Internal implementation files\n  - `Public/`: Public header files\n- `Content/`: Plugin assets\n- `MCP/`: Python client scripts and examples\n- `Resources/`: Icons and other resources\n\n## License\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 kvick\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Start the server:\n   ```\n   python server.py\n   ```\n\n2. Connect to the server using an MCP client (like Claude Desktop)\n\n3. Use the provided tools to manage scripts:\n   - `add_script(name, content)` - Add a new script\n   - `edit_script(name, content)` - Edit an existing script\n   - `execute_script(name, blend_file=None)` - Execute a script in Blender, optionally specifying a .blend file\n   - `remove_script(name)` - Remove a script\n\n4. Access resources to get information:\n   - `scripts://list` - Get list of available scripts\n   - `script://{name}` - Get content of a specific script\n   - `result://{name}` - Get execution result of a script\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic Example\n\n```python\n# Add a simple script\nadd_script(\"hello_cube\", '''\nimport bpy\n\n# Clear existing objects\nbpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')\nbpy.ops.object.delete()\n\n# Create a cube\nbpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=2, location=(0, 0, 0))\nprint(\"Cube created!\")\n''')\n\n# Execute the script\nexecute_script(\"hello_cube\")\n\n# Get the result\n# Access using: result://hello_cube\n```\n\n### Working with Blend Files\n\n```python\n# Add a script that works with a blend file\nadd_script(\"analyze_scene\", '''\nimport bpy\n\n# Print information about the current scene\nprint(f\"Current Blender version: {bpy.app.version_string}\")\nprint(f\"Current file: {bpy.data.filepath}\")\n\n# List all objects in the scene\nprint(\"\\\\nObjects in the scene:\")\nfor obj in bpy.data.objects:\n    print(f\" - {obj.name} ({obj.type})\")\n''')\n\n# Execute with a specific blend file\nexecute_script(\"analyze_scene\", blend_file=\"/path/to/your/project.blend\")\n\n# Get the result\n# Access using: result://analyze_scene\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. When a script is added, it's stored in the `script_files/scripts` directory\n2. When executed, the script is run in a headless Blender instance\n   - If a blend file is specified, Blender will open that file before running the script\n   - Otherwise, a default empty Blender scene is used\n3. Output and errors are captured and stored in the `script_files/results` directory\n4. Metadata about scripts is tracked in `script_files/metadata.json`\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Install the MCP library: `pip install mcp`\n3. Ensure Blender is installed and accessible from your PATH\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Install fb-idb via pip in the virtual environment\n\nNote: Make sure to keep the virtual environment activated while using the server. If you close your terminal and come back later, you'll need to reactivate the virtual environment with the `source venv/bin/activate` command before running `npm start`.\n\n## 🔌 MCP Integration\n\nTo use this server with Claude or other LLM assistants:\n\n1. Add the server to your MCP settings in Claude Desktop:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"ios-simulator\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb/dist/index.js\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. The LLM can now use natural language commands to control iOS simulators:\n\n```\ncreate a simulator session with iPhone 14\ninstall app /path/to/my-app.ipa\nlaunch app com.example.myapp\ntap at 100, 200\ntake a screenshot\n```\n\n## 📚 Usage as a Library\n\nYou can also use this package as a library in your own projects:\n\n### 🔰 Basic Usage\n\n```typescript\nimport { createMCPServer } from 'mcp-server-simulator-ios-idb';\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Create an instance of the MCP server\n  const { orchestrator } = createMCPServer();\n  \n  // Process natural language commands\n  \n  // Create a simulator session\n  const sessionResult = await orchestrator.processInstruction('create session');\n  console.log(`Session created: ${sessionResult.data}`);\n  \n  // Interact with the simulator\n  await orchestrator.processInstruction('tap at 100, 200');\n  \n  // Capture a screenshot\n  const screenshotResult = await orchestrator.processInstruction('take screenshot');\n  console.log(`Screenshot saved at: ${screenshotResult.data}`);\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n### 🚀 Advanced Usage\n\nYou can also use the individual components

Download the `addon.py` file from this repo\n\n2. Open Blender\n\n3. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons\n\n4. Click \"Install...\" and select the `addon.py` file\n\n5. Enable the addon by checking the box next to \"Interface: Blender MCP - IFC\"\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the Connection\n\n1. In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press N if not visible)\n\n2. Find the \"Blender MCP - IFC\" tab\n\n3. Click \"Connect to Claude\"\n\n4. Make sure the MCP server is running\n\n### Using with Claude\n\nOnce connected, you'll see a hammer icon in Claude's interface with tools for the Blender MCP IFC integration.\n\n## IFC Tools\n\nThis repo includes multiple IFC-specific tools that enable comprehensive querying and manipulation of IFC models:\n\n**get_ifc_project_info**: Retrieves basic information about the IFC project, including name, description, and counts of different entity types. Example: \"What is the basic information about this IFC project?\"\n\n**list_ifc_entities**: Lists IFC entities of a specific type (walls, doors, spaces, etc.) with options to limit results and filter by selection. Example: \"List all the walls in this IFC model\" or \"Show me the windows in this building\"\n\n**get_ifc_properties**: Retrieves all properties of a specific IFC entity by its GlobalId or from currently selected objects. Example: \"What are the properties of this wall with ID 1Dvrgv7Tf5IfTEapMkwDQY?\"\n\n**get_ifc_spatial_structure**: Gets the spatial hierarchy of the IFC model (site, building, storeys, spaces). Example: \"Show me the spatial structure of this building\"\n\n**get_ifc_relationships**: Retrieves all relationships for a specific IFC entity. Example: \"What are the relationships of the entrance door?\"\n\n**get_selected_ifc_entities**: Gets information about IFC entities corresponding to objects currently selected in the Blender UI. Example: \"Tell me about the elements I've selected in Blender\"\n\n**get_user_view**: Captures the current Blender viewport as an image, allowing visualization of the model from the user's perspective. Example: \"Show me what the user is currently seeing in Blender\"\n\n**export_ifc_data**: Exports IFC data to a structured JSON or CSV file, with options to filter by entity type or building level. Example: \"Export all wall data to a CSV file\"\n\n**place_ifc_object**: Creates and positions an IFC element in the model at specified coordinates with optional rotation. Example: \"Place a door at coordinates X:10, Y:5, Z:0 with 90 degrees rotation\"\n\n**get_ifc_quantities**: Calculate and get quantities (m2, m3, etc.) for IFC elements, with options to filter by entity type or selected ones. Example: \"Give me the area of all the walls in the building using the tool get_ifc_quantities\"\n\n**export_drawing_png**: Exports 2D and 3D drawings as high-resolution PNG images with customizable resolution and view parameters. Creates orthographic plan views from above at specified height offsets. Example: \"Generate a floor plan PNG for the ground floor at 1920x1080 resolution\"\n\n**get_ifc_georeferencing_info**: Retrieves comprehensive georeferencing information from IFC files including coordinate reference systems (CRS), map conversions, world coordinate systems, true north direction, and site geographic coordinates. Example: \"What georeferencing information is available in this IFC model?\"\n\n**georeference_ifc_model**: Creates or updates georeferencing information in IFC models, allowing you to set coordinate reference systems using EPSG codes or custom CRS definitions, establish map conversions with eastings/northings coordinates, and configure site geographic positioning. Example: \"Georeference this IFC model using EPSG:4326 with coordinates at latitude 40.7589, longitude -73.9851\"\n\n## MCP Resources\n\nThis integration provides access to structured documentation through MCP resources:\n\n**file://table_of_contents.md**: Contains the complete technical report structure template for generating comprehensive building reports. This resource provides a standardized table of contents that can be used as a reference when creating technical documentation from IFC models.\n\n## MCP Prompts\n\nThe server includes specialized MCP Prompts for automated report generation:\n\n**Technical_building_report**: Generates comprehensive technical building reports based on IFC models loaded in Blender. This prompt provides a structured workflow for creating professional architectural documentation in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese). The prompt guides the analysis through systematic data extraction from the IFC model, including spatial structure, quantities, materials, and building systems, culminating in a complete technical report with drawings and 3D visualizations.\n\n## Execute Blender Code\n\nLegacy feature from the original MCP implementation. Allows Claude to execute arbitrary Python code in Blender. Use with caution.\n\n## Sequential Thinking Tool\n\nThis integration includes the Sequential Thinking tool for structured problem-solving and analysis. It facilitates a step-by-step thinking process that can branch, revise, and adapt as understanding deepens - perfect for complex IFC model analysis or planning tasks.\n\nExample: \"Use sequential thinking to analyze this building's energy efficiency based on the IFC model\"\n\n## Example Commands\n\nHere are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do with IFC models:\n\n- \"Analyze this IFC model and tell me how many walls, doors and windows it has\"\n\n- \"Show me the spatial structure of this building model\"\n\n- \"List all spaces in this IFC model and their properties\"\n\n- \"Identify all structural elements in this building\"\n\n- \"What are the relationships between this wall and other elements?\"\n\n- \"Generate a report of the measurements from the IFC model opened in Blender\"\n\n- \"Use sequential thinking to create a maintenance plan for this building based on the IFC model\"\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Connection issues**: Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured in Claude\n- **IFC model not loading**: Verify that you have the Bonsai BIM addon installed and that an IFC file is loaded\n- **Timeout errors**: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps\n\n**Docker:**\n\n- **\"Connection refused\" errors**: Make sure Blender is running and the addon is enabled with the server started\n- **CORS issues**: The API has CORS enabled by default for all origins. If you encounter issues, check your client's CORS settings\n- **Performance concerns**: For large IFC models, the API responses might be slower. Consider adjusting timeouts in your client\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe IFC integration uses the Bonsai BIM module to access ifcopenshell functionality within Blender. The communication follows the same JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets as the original BlenderMCP.\n\n## Limitations & Security Considerations\n\n- The `execute_blender_code` tool from the original project is still available, allowing running arbitrary Python code in Blender. Use with caution and always save your work.\n\n- Complex IFC models may require breaking down operations into smaller steps.\n\n- IFC query performance depends on model size and complexity.\n\n- Get User View tool returns a base64 encoded image. Please ensure the client supports it.\n\n## Contributions\n\nThis MIT licensed repo is open to be forked, modified and used in any way. I'm open to ideas and collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in contact with me for contributions.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Original BlenderMCP by [Siddharth Ahuja](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp)\n\n- Sequential Thinking tool from [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking)\n\n- IFC integration built upon the Bonsai BIM addon for Blender\n\n## TO DO\n\nIntegration and testing with more MCP Clients\n",

It's really the architecture design and simplicity that has been the initial focus.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the tools registered with Maya MCP.\r\n\r\n## Basic Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| list_objects_by_type | Get a list of objects in the scene. Use filter_by to filter for certain objects such as \"cameras\", \"lights\", \"materials\", or \"shapes\". |\r\n| create_object | Create an object in the Maya scene. Object types available are cube, cone, sphere, cylinder, camera, spotLight, pointLight, directionalLight. |\r\n| get_object_attributes | Get a list of attributes on a Maya object. | \r\n| set_object_attributes | Set an object's attribute with a specific value. |\r\n| scene_new | Create a new scene in Maya. Use the force argument to force a new scene when an existing scene is loaded and has been modified. |\r\n| scene_open | Load in a scene into Maya. | \r\n| scene_save | Save the current scene. If the filename is not specified, it will save it as its current name. |\r\n| select_object | Select an object in the scene. |\r\n\r\n## Advanced Modeling Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| create_advanced_model | Create complex 3D models like cars, trees, buildings, cups, and chairs with detailed parameters. |\r\n| mesh_operations | Perform modeling operations such as extrude, bevel, subdivide, boolean, combine, bridge, and split. |\r\n| create_material | Create and assign materials with various types (lambert, phong, wood, marble, chrome, glass, etc.) |\r\n| create_curve | Generate NURBS curves for various shapes (line, circle, spiral, helix, star, gear, etc.) |\r\n| curve_modeling | Create geometry using curve-based modeling techniques (extrude, loft, revolve, sweep, etc.) |\r\n| organize_objects | Organize objects through grouping, parenting, layout, alignment, and distribution. |\r\n| generate_scene | Generate complete 3D scenes with multiple objects (city, forest, living room, office, park) |\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMaya MCP server is designed so there is only an MCP server and doesn't require anything to be installed within Maya. This is helpful since you can easily use different versions of Maya and not have to worry about coordinating version changes. This is done by taking advantage of the default Command Port Maya opens up for MEL scripting. \r\n\r\nMCP requires Python 3.10 or greater. Currently using pip as the package requirements are minimal. To install the virtual environment:\r\n\r\n1. download this project\r\n2. Create a virtual env using Python 3.10+ in the project directory. ```python -m venv .venv```\r\n3. activate the virtual environment\r\n   * Windows: ```.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat```\r\n   * Mac/Linux: ```source .venv\\bin\\activate.sh```\r\n4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```\r\n\r\nAs stated, there is nothing to install for Maya.\r\n\r\n### MCP Client Configuration\r\n\r\nDepending on which MCP Client you're using, the configuration file location differs. For [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), go to File -> Settings -> Developer Tab and press the Edit Config button. This will bring up the file finder in the directory location of the JSON config file.\r\n\r\nNext you need to edit the config JSON file by hand using a text editor.  Make sure to use full file paths.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"MayaMCP\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/.venv/Scripts/python.exe\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/src/maya_mcp_server.py\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the changes have been made, restart Claude Desktop (use Exit menu item instead of just closing the window). In the Developers Tab, you will now see the Maya MCP server listed.\r\n\r\nIn Claude Desktop, you can verify the Maya MCP tools are available. Press the ![](docs/CluadeDesktop-MCP-Tools-Available-Button.jpg) button and a detailed popup will appear.\r\n\r\n![](docs/CluadeDesktop-MCP-Tools-Available-Detailed.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Maya Communications\r\n\r\nWhen the Maya MCP server first attempts to communicate with Maya, you will get this popup within Maya. Please click \"Allow All\" to allow for ongoing communication between the MCP server and Maya. This will need to be done each Maya session.\r\n\r\n![](docs/MayaSecurityWarning-RunScript.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP Server module was designed to be easily modified in a non-intrusive way. This is done by having the Maya Python code reside in the MCP server and sent to Maya's command port for execution. The results are sent back to the server and processed.\r\n\r\nThe default Maya command port runs MEL so the Python code is modified to run within MEL function call to the Python interpreter. There is also some limits such as multi-line Python code can't have any returned results. So, each command creates two connections to Maya. First to run the operation and save the results. The second connection then to read back the results. \r\n\r\nTo help minimize populating the namespace in the Maya global Python interpreter, functions and variables sent to Maya will be scoped to start with _mcp_maya_*. Each of the Maya tools are scoped into a function named _mcp_maya_scope(). The results are assigned to the variable _mcp_maya_results. This way should significantly reduce the possibility of name collisions. \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of elegance to this design. You basically can just add the Python file, restart the MCP Client and Maya MCP server and go. You don't need to integrate the operations on both the Maya MCP server and Maya itself. The code you add is only Maya specific Python and doesn't need to add any MCP decorators. This is a much better design to grow and adapt to different installations instead of having a fixed set of tools.\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP server was built using the low-level Python MCP module. This was necessary to allow for dynamically defining all of the tools at run time. The tool function signatures are captured dynamically at the start of the server. \r\n\r\n### Adding New Tools\r\n\r\nIt is easy to add new tools to Maya MCP. You don't need to change any of the existing code. All you need to do is add a single tool command Python file to the mayatools/thirdparty directory. The tool itself will run in Maya so it will have access to all of the Maya Python modules. There are a few programmer notes in the design of the tool.\r\n\r\n* The name of the Python file and the function name must be the same. Make sure it is unique.\r\n* The Python function will be loaded by both the server and Maya. Any code outside of the function must be able to be loaded into standalone Python. Meaning any imports such as maya.cmds should be done in the scope of the function. The MCP server loads the function so it can inspect the function signature to send the information to MCP Client via JSON-RPC.\r\n* The function signature will be parsed and must include any types in the function argument annotation.\r\n* When your function is sent to Maya, it will be scoped within am _mcp_maya_scope function. This provides a number of benefits. The functions sent to Maya will not polute the Python global space too much running in Maya. Plus, any exceptions thrown will be caught and returned back to the MCP Client as errors.\r\n* Generally, you want to return either a list or dictionary or throw an exception when there is an error.\r\n* Name your function and arguments appropriately so the LLM can understand the operation. Include a function doc string.\r\n* Default arguments are good. \r\n* Error checking is good so error messages can provide better failed explanations.\r\n\r\nI recommend looking at the existing Maya tools in this project as examples.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nCurrently Maya MCP has only been tested on Windows. Should work on both Linux and Mac as everything is using standard Python.\r\n\r\n## Future Ideas\r\n\r\nIt's early days for MCP and there is a lot to improve. Here are some ideas.\r\n\r\n* Expose more functionality.\r\n* Improve using prompt engineering, particularly describing Maya's usage and data relationships.\r\n* Everything is registered as tools, allow for resources and prompts.\r\n* It could be possible to find any plugins within Maya that has MCP tools. Maybe something like looking at the PYTHONPATH within Maya with any directory named MCP. All of those could be inspected and then provided back to the MCP Client.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\r\n* [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\r\n* [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\r\n* [Unreal MCP](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important Note\r\n\r\nThis project was done on my personal time and equipment to learn about MCP.

      "readme_content": "# Unreal-Blender MCP\n\nUnreal-Blender MCP is a unified server for controlling both Blender and Unreal Engine via AI agents using the MCP (Machine Control Protocol) approach.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project extends the [blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp.git) framework to include support for Unreal Engine, allowing AI agents like Claude and ChatGPT to simultaneously control both platforms through a single interface.\n\n## Submodule Information\n\nThis project includes `blender-mcp` as a Git submodule. When cloning the repository, use the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Clone with submodules\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/tahooki/unreal-blender-mcp.git\n\n# Or clone normally and then initialize submodules\ngit clone https://github.com/tahooki/unreal-blender-mcp.git\ncd unreal-blender-mcp\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- **Unified Control**: Single MCP server to control both Blender and Unreal Engine\n- **AI Agent Integration**: Designed to work with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants\n- **Blender Features**: Retains all blender-mcp functionality including:\n  - Scene manipulation\n  - Object creation and editing\n  - Material management\n  - PolyHaven asset integration\n  - Hyper3D Rodin model generation\n- **Unreal Engine Features**:\n  - Level creation and management\n  - Asset importing\n  - Python code execution\n  - Scene manipulation\n- **Extension Structure**: Easily extend both Blender addon and server while maintaining compatibility with upstream updates\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe system consists of three main components:\n\n1. **MCP Server**: Central hub communicating with AI agents via SSE (Server-Sent Events) on port 8000\n2. **Blender Addon**: Socket server within Blender on port 8400 (standard) or 8401 (extended)\n3. **Unreal Plugin**: HTTP server within Unreal Engine on port 8500\n\n```\n[AI Agent] <--SSE--> [MCP Server (8300)] \n                        |\n                        |--HTTP--> [Blender Addon (8400)]\n                        |\n                        |--HTTP--> [Unreal Plugin (8500)]\n```\n\n## Extension Structure\n\nThis project uses an extension approach to maintain compatibility with upstream changes:\n\n- **Blender Addon Extension**: Extends the original `BlenderMCPServer` while keeping the original code intact\n- **Server Extension**: Enhances the original server with additional tools and Unreal Engine integration\n- **Interface Tools**: Provides utilities for installing, configuring, and running extensions\n\nThis approach allows easy updates from the original projects without code conflicts.\n\n## Step-by-Step Installation and Setup Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10 or later\n- Blender 3.0 or later\n- Unreal Engine 5.0 or later\n- uv package manager (install with `pip install uv` if you don't have it)\n\n### 1. Clone the Repository\n\n```bash\n# Clone with submodules (recommended)\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/tahooki/unreal-blender-mcp.git\ncd unreal-blender-mcp\n\n# Or if you already cloned without --recursive:\ngit clone https://github.com/tahooki/unreal-blender-mcp.git\ncd unreal-blender-mcp\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### 2. Set Up Python Environment\n\n```bash\n# Create a virtual environment and activate it\nuv venv\n# On Windows:\n.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n# On macOS/Linux:\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install project dependencies\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### 3. Install Blender Addon\n\nChoose ONE of the following options:\n\n#### Option A: Standard Addon (Original blender-mcp)\n1. Open Blender\n2. Navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons\n3. Click \"Install...\" button\n4. Browse and select `blender-mcp/addon.py` file\n5. Enable the \"Interface: Blender MCP\" addon (check the box)\n\n#### Option B: Extended Addon (With additional features)\n1. Run the extension installer script:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"from src.unreal_blender_mcp.blender_addon import BlenderAddonManager; BlenderAddonManager().install_to_blender(force=True)\"\n   ```\n2. Open Blender\n3. Navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons\n4. Find and enable the \"Interface: Extended Blender MCP\" addon (check the box)\n\n### 4. Install Unreal Engine Plugin\n\n1. Locate the `UEPythonServer` folder in this project\n2. Copy the entire folder to your Unreal project's `Plugins` directory\n   - If your project doesn't have a `Plugins` directory, create one\n3. Start Unreal Engine with your project\n4. Navigate to Edit > Plugins in the menu\n5. Find and enable the Python Server plugin\n6. Restart Unreal Engine when prompted\n\n### 5. Start the MCP Server\n\nChoose ONE of the following options:\n\n#### Option A: Standard Server\n```bash\n# Make sure your virtual environment is activated\npython main.py\n```\n\n#### Option B: Extended Server (More features)\n```bash\n# Make sure your virtual environment is activated\npython run_extended_server.py\n\n# Optional: Customize server options\npython run_extended_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --log-level DEBUG\n```\n\n### 6. Enable the Blender Server Connection\n\n1. Start Blender (if not already running)\n2. In the 3D viewport, press `N` to open the sidebar panel\n3. Select the appropriate tab:\n   - \"BlenderMCP\" (if using standard addon)\n   - \"ExtBlenderMCP\" (if using extended addon)\n4. Click the \"Start Server\" button\n5. Verify the server starts successfully (check console output)\n\n### 7. Verify Unreal Engine Connection\n\n1. With Unreal Engine running and plugin enabled\n2. The Python server should automatically start\n3. Check the Output Log (Window > Developer Tools > Output Log) for any messages\n4. The Unreal plugin should now be ready to receive commands\n\n### 8. Connect an AI Agent\n\n#### Option A: Integrate with Claude for Desktop\n\nAdd the following to Claude for Desktop's configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"unreal-blender\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"unreal-blender-mcp\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"unreal-blender-ext\": {\n            \"command\": \"python\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"/path/to/unreal-blender-mcp/run_extended_server.py\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nReplace `/path/to/` with your actual project path.\n\n#### Option B: Integrate with Cursor\n\n1. Open Cursor Settings\n2. Navigate to MCP section\n3. Add the following commands:\n   - Standard Server: `uvx unreal-blender-mcp`\n   - Extended Server: `python /path/to/unreal-blender-mcp/run_extended_server.py`\n   \n   Replace `/path/to/` with your actual project path.\n\n#### Option C: Integrate with Other AI Tools\n\nRefer to your AI tool's documentation for integrating with MCP servers, and point it to:\n- MCP Server URL: `http://localhost:8000` (or custom port if specified)\n\n### 9. Testing the System\n\nOnce all components are running:\n\n1. Use your AI agent to interact with Blender by asking it to:\n   - Create a simple cube or sphere\n   - Modify object properties\n   - Create materials\n\n2. Use your AI agent to interact with Unreal Engine by asking it to:\n   - Create a new level\n   - Place assets\n   - Modify scene properties\n\n3. Try more complex operations that involve both platforms working together\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Check that all servers are running (MCP, Blender, Unreal)\n2. Verify port configurations match (default: 8000 for MCP, 8400/8401 for Blender, 8500 for Unreal)\n3. Check console outputs for error messages\n4. Restart components in the correct order: MCP server first, then Blender, then Unreal Engine\n\nFor more detailed information on development and extending the system, see the [Project Document](Project-document.md) and [workflow](workflow/) directory.\n\n## Comparison: Standard vs Extended\n\n| Feature | Standard Server | Extended Server |\n|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| Blender Control | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Unreal Control | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Custom Blender Commands | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Enhanced Scene Info | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Auto Feature Detection | ❌ | ✅ |\n| Upstream Compatibility | ✅ | ✅ |\n\nChoose the standard server for basic functionality or the extended server for advanced features.\n\n## Development\n\nSee the [Project Document](Project-document.md) and [workflow](workflow/) directory for detailed development information.\n\nFor extending this project:\n- To add new Blender addon features: Modify `src/unreal_blender_mcp/blender_addon/extended_addon.py`\n- To add new server tools: Modify `src/unreal_blender_mcp/server_extension/extended_server.py`\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- This project builds upon [blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp.git) by Siddharth Ahuja.\n\n## Future Developments\n\nThe following improvements are planned for future releases:\n\n### Structured Unreal Engine API\n\nCurrently, the Unreal Engine communication relies primarily on direct Python code execution.

It creates a unified TypeScript interface for LLMs to interact with Blender, Maya, Unreal Engine, and other 3D applications through a single coherent API.\n\n```typescript\n// LLMs use the same interface regardless of underlying 3D software\nawait tools.animation.createKeyframe({\n  objectId: \"cube_1\",\n  property: \"rotation.x\",\n  time: 30,\n  value: Math.PI/2\n});\n```\n\n## Core Philosophy & Design Decisions\n\n3D-MCP is built on four interconnected architectural principles that together create a unified system for 3D content creation:\n\n1. **Entity-First Design**: Well-defined domain entities form the foundation of all operations, enabling consistent data modeling across platforms\n2. **Type-Safe CRUD Operations**: Automated generation of create, read, update, delete operations with complete type validation\n3. **Atomic Operation Layer**: A minimal set of platform-specific implementations that handle fundamental operations\n4. **Composable Tool Architecture**: Complex functionality built by combining atomic operations in a platform-agnostic way\n\nThis architecture creates a **dependency inversion** where platform-specific implementation details are isolated to atomic operations, while the majority of the codebase remains platform-independent.\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                             LLM / User API                              │\n└───────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    │ MCP Tool API\n                                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                          Compound Operations                            │\n│                                                                         │\n│  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │ Modeling Tools  │  │ Animation Tools │  │ Rigging Tools           │  │\n│  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘  │\n└───────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    │ Implemented by\n                                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                           Atomic Operations                             │\n│                                                                         │\n│  ┌─────────── Entity CRUD ────────────┐ ┌────────── Non-CRUD ─────────┐ │ \n│  │ create{Entity}s update{Entity}s ...│ │  select, undo, redo, etc.   │ │  \n│  └────────────────────────────────────┘ └─────────────────────────────┘ │\n└───────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    │ Plug-in Server Request\n                                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                       Platform-Specific Adapters                        │\n│                                                                         │\n│  ┌──── Blender ────┐  ┌────── Maya ─────┐  ┌─── Unreal Engine ────┐     │\n│  │ createKeyframes │  │ createKeyframes │  │ createKeyframes      │     │    \n│  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘     │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Why These Design Decisions?\n\n**Entity-First Design** was chosen because:\n- 3D applications use different object models but share core concepts (meshes, materials, animations)\n- Zod schemas provide single-source-of-truth for validation, typing, and documentation\n- Strong typing catches errors at compile time rather than runtime\n- Rich metadata enables better AI understanding of domain objects\n\n**CRUD Operations as Foundation** because:\n- They map cleanly to what 3D applications need to do with entities\n- Standardized patterns reduce cognitive overhead\n- Auto-generation eliminates repetitive code using `createCrudOperations`\n- Every entity automatically gets the same consistent interface\n\n**Atomic and Compound Tool Separation** because:\n- Only atomic tools need platform-specific implementation (~20% of codebase)\n- Compound tools work across all platforms without modification (~80% of codebase)\n- New platforms only need to implement atomic operations to gain all functionality\n- Maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### 1. Entity-Centric CRUD Architecture\n\nThe system's foundation is a rich type system of domain entities that generates CRUD operations:\n\n```typescript\n// Define entities with rich metadata using Zod\nexport const Mesh = NodeBase.extend({\n  vertices: z.array(Tensor.VEC3).describe(\"Array of vertex positions [x, y, z]\"),\n  normals: z.array(Tensor.VEC3).optional().describe(\"Array of normal vectors\"),\n  // ... other properties\n});\n\n// CRUD operations generated automatically from entity schemas\nconst entityCruds = createCrudOperations(ModelEntities);\n// => Creates createMeshs, getMeshs, updateMeshs, deleteMeshs, listMeshs\n\n// All operations preserve complete type information\nawait tool.createRigControls.execute({\n  name: \"arm_ctrl\",          \n  shape: \"cube\",            // TypeScript error if not a valid enum value\n  targetJointIds: [\"joint1\"], // Must be string array\n  color: [0.2, 0.4, 1],     // Must match Color schema format\n  // IDE autocomplete shows all required/optional fields\n});\n```\n\nEntity schemas provide:\n- **Schema Validation**: Runtime parameter checking with detailed error messages\n- **Type Information**: Complete TypeScript types for IDE assistance\n- **Documentation**: Self-documenting API with descriptions\n- **Code Generation**: Templates for platform-specific implementations\n\n#### Entity Architecture Diagram\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                Core Entity Definitions                       │\n│                                                              │\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐   │\n│  │ BaseEntity  │  │ NodeBase    │  │ Other Core Entities │   │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘   │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                           ▲\n                           │ extends\n                           │\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                Domain-Specific Entities                      │\n│                                                              │\n│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐   │\n│  │ Model       │  │ Animation   │  │ Rigging             │   │\n│  │ Entities    │  │ Entities    │  │ Entities            │   │\n│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘   │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           │ input to\n                           ▼\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                Automatic CRUD Generation                     │\n│                                                              │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │\n│  │ createCrudOperations(Entities)                          │ │\n│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           │ generates\n                           ▼\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     Atomic Operations                        │\n│                                                              │\n│  ┌─────────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐    │\n│  │ create{Entity}s │ │ get{Entity}s │ │ update{Entity}s │ .. │\n│  └─────────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └─────────────────┘    │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                           │\n                           │ foundation for\n                           ▼\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Compound Operations                       │\n│                                                              │\n│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │\n│  │ No need for platform-specific code.

Compound Tool Architecture\n\nThe system creates a clear separation between atomic and compound operations:\n\n```typescript\n// From compounded.ts - Higher level operations composed from atomic operations\ncreateIKFKSwitch: defineCompoundTool({\n  // ...parameter and return definitions...\n  execute: async (params) => {\n    // Create IK chain using atomic operations\n    const ikChainResult = await tool.createIKChains.execute({/*...*/});\n    \n    // Create control with full type-checking\n    const ikControlResult = await tool.createRigControls.execute({\n      name: `${switchName}_IK_CTRL`,\n      shape: ikControlShape,  // Type-checked against schema\n      targetJointIds: [jointIds[jointIds.length - 1]],\n      color: ikColor,\n      // ...other parameters\n    });\n    \n    // Position the control at the end effector\n    await tool.batchTransform.execute({/*...*/});\n    \n    // Create constraints to connect the system\n    await tool.createConstraint.execute({/*...*/});\n    \n    // Return standardized response with created IDs\n    return {\n      success: true,\n      switchControlId: switchControlResult.id,\n      ikControlId: ikControlResult.id,\n      fkControlIds,\n      poleVectorId: poleVectorId || undefined,\n    };\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis architecture provides several technical advantages:\n\n1. **Atomic Operations** (~20% of the system):\n   - Directly interact with platform APIs\n   - Need platform-specific implementations\n   - Focus on single entity operations (create, read, update, delete)\n   - Form minimal implementation required for new platforms\n\n2. **Compound Operations** (~80% of the system):\n   - Built entirely from atomic operations\n   - Zero platform-specific code\n   - Implement higher-level domain concepts\n   - Work on any platform without modification\n\n#### Tool Composition Flow\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                        High-Level Tool Definition                       │\n└──────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘\n                                       │\n                                       ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                         Compound Tool Pattern                           │\n│                                                                         │\n│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │\n│  │ defineCompoundTool({                                             │   │\n│  │   description: string,                                           │   │\n│  │   parameters: zod.Schema,                                        │   │\n│  │   returns: zod.Schema,                                           │   │\n│  │   execute: async (params) => {                                   │   │\n│  │     // Composed entirely from atomic operations                  │   │\n│  │     await tool.atomicOperation1.execute({...});                  │   │\n│  │     await tool.atomicOperation2.execute({...});                  │   │\n│  │     return { success: true, ...results };                        │   │\n│  │   }                                                              │   │\n│  │ })                                                               │   │\n│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │\n└───────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┘\n                                    │ Plug-in Server Request\n                                    ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                         Platform Adaptation                             │\n│                                                                         │\n│  ┌──────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │ Blender Implementation   │  │ Maya Implementation                 │  │\n│  │ of Atomic Operations     │  │ of Atomic Operations                │  │\n│  └──────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────────────────┘  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nKey files for the compound tool architecture:\n- compounded.ts: Compound modeling tools\n- compounded.ts: Compound animation tools\n- compounded.ts: Compound rigging tools\n\n### 3. Code Generation Pipeline\n\nThe system automatically generates platform-specific implementations from TypeScript definitions:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐\n│ Entity Schemas  │     │ Schema             │     │ Platform-Specific Code  │\n│ & Tools (TS)    │ ──> │ Extraction (TS)    │ ──> │ (Python/C++/etc.)       │\n└─────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────┘\n      │                        │                             │\n      │                        │                             │\n      ▼                        ▼                             ▼\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐\n│ Type            │     │ Parameter          │     │ Implementation          │\n│ Definitions     │     │ Validation         │     │ Templates               │\n└─────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nKey aspects of the generation system:\n- **Entity Extraction**: Analyzes Zod schemas to understand entity structure\n- **Parameter Mapping**: Converts TypeScript types to platform-native types\n- **Validation Generation**: Creates parameter validation in target languages\n- **Implementation Templates**: Provides platform-specific code patterns\n\nThe codegen system is implemented in:\n- [plugin-codegen.ts](./packages/scripts/plugin-codegen.ts): Main code generation script\n- [extract-schemas.ts](./packages/scripts/extract-schemas.ts): Extracts Zod schemas from TypeScript files into temporary JSON files.\n\n### 4. Domain Organization\n\nThe system is organized into domains that mirror 3D content creation workflows:\n\n- **Core**: Base entities and operations used across all domains\n- **Modeling**: Mesh creation, editing, and topology operations\n- **Animation**: Keyframes, curves, clips, and animation control\n- **Rigging**: Skeletal systems, controls, and deformation\n- **Rendering**: Materials, lights, and render settings\n\nEach domain follows the same organizational pattern:\n- [`entity.ts`](./packages/src/tool/animation/entity.ts): Domain-specific entity definitions\n- [`atomic.ts`](./packages/src/tool/animation/atomic.ts): Atomic operations for domain entities\n- [`compounded.ts`](./packages/src/tool/animation/compounded.ts): Higher-level operations built from atomic tools\n\n#### Domain Structure Diagram\n\n```\npackages/src/tool/\n│\n├── core/                  # Core shared components\n│   ├── entity.ts          # Base entities all domains use\n│   ├── utils.ts           # Shared utilities including CRUD generation\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── model/                 # Modeling domain\n│   ├── entity.ts          # Mesh, Vertex, Face, etc.\n│   ├── atomic.ts          # Atomic modeling operations\n│   ├── compounded.ts      # Higher-level modeling tools\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── animation/             # Animation domain\n│   ├── entity.ts          # Keyframe, AnimCurve, Clip, etc.\n│   ├── atomic.ts          # Atomic animation operations\n│   ├── compounded.ts      # Higher-level animation tools\n│   └── ...\n│\n├── rig/                   # Rigging domain\n│   ├── entity.ts          # Joint, IKChain, Control, etc.\n│   ├── atomic.ts          # Atomic rigging operations\n│   ├── compounded.ts      # Higher-level rigging tools\n│   └── ...\n│\n└── rendering/             # Rendering domain\n    ├── entity.ts          # Camera, Light, RenderSettings, etc.\n    ├── atomic.ts          # Atomic rendering operations\n    ├── compounded.ts      # Higher-level rendering tools\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### 5. Entity-Centric CRUD Architecture\n\nThe system implements a sophisticated entity-centric approach where:\n\n1. **Entities as Domain Models**: Each domain (modeling, animation, rigging) defines its core entities that represent its fundamental concepts. These are implemented as Zod schemas with rich type information.\n\n2. **CRUD as Foundation**: Every entity automatically receives a complete set of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through the `createCrudOperations` utility:\n\n```typescript\n// Each domain starts with CRUD operations for all its entities\nconst entityCruds = createCrudOperations(ModelEntities);\n\nconst modelAtomicTools = {\n  ...entityCruds,  // Foundation of all atomic tools\n  // Domain-specific operations build on this foundation\n}\n```\n\n3. **Entity Reuse and Inheritance**: Core entities defined in `core/entity.ts` are extended by domain-specific entities, promoting code reuse and consistent design across domains.\n\n4. **DDD-Inspired Architecture**: The system follows Domain-Driven Design principles by organizing code around domain entities and aggregates rather than technical concerns.\n\nThis architecture provides several key benefits:\n\n- **Consistency**: All entities have the same patterns for basic operations\n- **Reduced Boilerplate**: CRUD operations are generated automatically  \n- **Clear Organization**: Tools are organized around domain entities\n- **Separation of Concerns**: Each domain manages its own entities while sharing common patterns\n\nThe combination of rich entity models with automatic CRUD operations creates a robust foundation that simplifies development while maintaining flexibility for domain-specific operations.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nbun install\n\n# Run the server\nbun run index.ts\n\n# Extract schemas and generate plugins\nbun run packages/scripts/plugin-codegen.ts\n```\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n1. **Define Entities**: Create or extend entity schemas in `src/tool/<domain>/entity.ts`\n2. **Generate CRUD**: Use `createCrudOperations` to generate atomic operations\n3. **Create Compound Tools**: Build higher-level operations from atomic tools\n4. **Generate Plugins**: Run the code generator to create platform-specific implementations\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe architectural decisions in 3D-MCP make it uniquely extensible:\n\n1. **Add New Entities**: Define new entities and automatically get CRUD operations\n2. **Add New Compound Tools**: Combine existing atomic operations to create new functionality\n3. **Add New Platforms**: Implement the atomic tool interfaces in a new plugin\n\nSee our contributing guide for more details on how to contribute.\n\n---\n\n*3D-MCP: One API to rule all 3D software*",

Each line represents a single MCP command with its parameters.\n\n2. **GUI Test Runner** (`tests/mcp_test_harness_gui.py`): A simple Tkinter GUI for running the test commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python tests/mcp_test_harness_gui.py\n   ```\n\n   The GUI allows you to:\n\n   - Select a JSONL test file\n   - Run the commands in sequence\n   - View the responses from Cinema 4D\n\nThis test harness is particularly useful for:\n\n- Rapidly testing new commands\n- Verifying plugin functionality after updates\n- Recreating complex scenes for debugging\n- Testing compatibility across different Cinema 4D versions\n\n## Troubleshooting & Debugging\n\n1. Check the log files:\n\n   ```bash\n   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n   ```\n\n2. Verify Cinema 4D shows connections in its console after you open Claude Desktop.\n\n3. Test the wrapper script directly:\n\n   ```bash\n   cinema4d-mcp-wrapper\n   ```\n\n4. If there are errors finding the mcp module, install it system-wide:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mcp\n   ```\n\n5. For advanced debugging, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):\n   ```bash\n   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /Users/username/cinema4d-mcp run cinema4d-mcp\n   ```\n\n## Project File Structure\n\n```\ncinema4d-mcp/\n├── .gitignore\n├── LICENSE\n├── README.md\n├── main.py\n├── pyproject.toml\n├── setup.py\n├── bin/\n│   └── cinema4d-mcp-wrapper\n├── c4d_plugin/\n│   └── mcp_server_plugin.pyp\n├── src/\n│   └── cinema4d_mcp/\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       ├── server.py\n│       ├── config.py\n│       └── utils.py\n└── tests/\n    ├── test_server.py\n    ├── mcp_test_harness.jsonl\n    └── mcp_test_harness_gui.py\n```\n\n## Tool Commands\n\n### General Scene & Execution\n\n- `get_scene_info`: Get summary info about the active Cinema 4D scene. ✅\n- `list_objects`: List all scene objects (with hierarchy). ✅\n- `group_objects`: Group selected objects under a new null. ✅\n- `execute_python`: Execute custom Python code inside Cinema 4D. ✅\n- `save_scene`: Save the current Cinema 4D project to disk. ✅\n- `load_scene`: Load a `.c4d` file into the scene. ✅\n- `set_keyframe`: Set a keyframe on an objects property (position, rotation, etc.). ✅\n\n### Object Creation & Modification\n\n- `add_primitive`: Add a primitive (cube, sphere, cone, etc.) to the scene. ✅\n- `modify_object`: Modify transform or attributes of an existing object. ✅\n- `create_abstract_shape`: Create an organic, non-standard abstract form. ✅\n\n### Cameras & Animation\n\n- `create_camera`: Add a new camera to the scene. ✅\n- `animate_camera`: Animate a camera along a path (linear or spline-based). ✅\n\n### Lighting & Materials\n\n- `create_light`: Add a light (omni, spot, etc.) to the scene. ✅\n- `create_material`: Create a standard Cinema 4D material. ✅\n- `apply_material`: Apply a material to a target object. ✅\n- `apply_shader`: Generate and apply a stylized or procedural shader. ✅\n\n### Redshift Support\n\n- `validate_redshift_materials`: Check Redshift material setup and connections. ✅ ⚠️ (Redshift materials not fully implemented)\n\n### MoGraph & Fields\n\n- `create_mograph_cloner`: Add a MoGraph Cloner (linear, radial, grid, etc.). ✅\n- `add_effector`: Add a MoGraph Effector (Random, Plain, etc.). ✅\n- `apply_mograph_fields`: Add and link a MoGraph Field to objects. ✅\n\n### Dynamics & Physics\n\n- `create_soft_body`: Add a Soft Body tag to an object. ✅\n- `apply_dynamics`: Apply Rigid or Soft Body physics. ✅\n\n### Rendering & Preview\n\n- `render_frame`: Render a frame and save it to disk (file-based output only). ⚠️ (Works, but fails on large resolutions due to MemoryError: Bitmap Init failed. This is a resource limitation.)\n- `render_preview`: Render a quick preview and return base64 image (for AI). ✅\n- `snapshot_scene`: Capture a snapshot of the scene (objects + preview image). ✅\n\n## Compatibility Plan & Roadmap\n\n| Cinema 4D Version | Python Version | Compatibility Status | Notes                                             |\n| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| R21 / S22         | Python 2.7     | ❌ Not supported     | Legacy API and Python version too old             |\n| R23               | Python 3.7     | 🔍 Not planned       | Not currently tested                              |\n| S24 / R25 / S26   | Python 3.9     | ⚠️ Possible (TBD)    | Requires testing and fallbacks for missing APIs   |\n| 2023.0 / 2023.1   | Python 3.9     | 🧪 In progress       | Targeting fallback support for core functionality |\n| 2023.2            | Python 3.10    | 🧪 In progress       | Aligns with planned testing base                  |\n| 2024.0            | Python 3.11    | ✅ Supported         | Verified                                          |\n| 2025.0+           | Python 3.11    | ✅ Fully Supported   | Primary development target                        |\n\n### Compatibility Goals\n\n- **Short Term**: Ensure compatibility with C4D 2023.1+ (Python 3.9 and 3.10)\n- **Mid Term**: Add conditional handling for missing MoGraph and Field APIs\n- **Long Term**: Consider optional legacy plugin module for R23–S26 support if demand arises\n\n## Recent Fixes\n\n- Context Awareness: Implemented robust object tracking using GUIDs. Commands creating objects return context (guid, actual_name, etc.). Subsequent commands correctly use GUIDs passed by the test harness/server to find objects reliably.\n- Object Finding: Reworked find_object_by_name to correctly handle GUIDs (numeric string format), fixed recursion errors, and improved reliability when doc.SearchObject fails.\n- GUID Detection: Command handlers (apply_material, create_mograph_cloner, add_effector, apply_mograph_fields, set_keyframe, group_objects) now correctly detect if identifiers passed in various parameters (object_name, target, target_name, list items) are GUIDs and search accordingly.\n- create_mograph_cloner: Fixed AttributeError for missing MoGraph parameters (like MG_LINEAR_PERSTEP) by using getattr fallbacks. Fixed logic bug where the found object wasn't correctly passed for cloning.\n- Rendering: Fixed TypeError in render_frame related to doc.ExecutePasses. snapshot_scene now correctly uses the working base64 render logic. Large render_frame still faces memory limits.\n- Registration: Fixed AttributeError for c4d.NilGuid.\n",
