# powershell

> This command may be mistaken as the cross-platform version of PowerShell (formerly known as PowerShell Core), which uses `pwsh` instead of `powershell`.
> The original `powershell` command in Windows is still available to use the legacy Windows version of PowerShell (version 5.1 and below).
> More information: <https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pwsh>.

`tldr pwsh`
